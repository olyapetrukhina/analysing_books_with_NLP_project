# Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Computational Linguistics course at the Higher School of Economics (HSE)** . It comprises a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks aimed at analyzing text data, particularly focusing on the book "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince." However, the methodologies employed can be applied to texts from various sources, making it a versatile tool for linguistic analysis.

## Features

**Text Preprocessing:** The project includes methods for lemmatization and frequency analysis to prepare the text data for further analysis.

**Keyword Extraction:** Techniques for identifying and extracting significant keywords from the text are implemented, allowing for deeper understanding of the themes and topics discussed in the book.

**Sentiment Analysis:** While sentiment analysis is not explicitly implemented in the current version, the project's architecture is designed to support the integration of sentiment analysis modules for future development.

**Named Entity Recognition (NER):** The project incorporates NER to identify and classify named entities in the text, providing insights into the characters, locations, and organizations mentioned in the book.

**Visualization:** Various visualization techniques, including word clouds, bar plots, and dependency trees, are employed to present the analyzed data in a clear and intuitive manner.

**Frequency Analysis:** Analyzes the frequency of words and identifies the most common tokens in the text.

**Chapter Splitting:** Splits the text into chapters for further analysis and summarization.

**Character Analysis:** Analyzes the roles, attributes, and relationships of characters in the book based on their linguistic features.

## Value Proposition

This project serves as a comprehensive toolkit for linguistic analysis, offering valuable insights into the structure, content, and sentiment of textual data. Its modular design allows for easy customization and extension, making it suitable for use in a wide range of applications beyond the analysis of "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince." Researchers, linguists, educators, and enthusiasts can leverage this project as a universal handbook for text analysis, enabling them to explore and interpret diverse literary works and textual data sets.

## Usage

To utilize this project for analyzing other texts, simply replace the input file with the desired text document and execute the relevant scripts or functions. The provided methodologies can be adapted and fine-tuned to suit the specific requirements and characteristics of different texts.

## Ideas for Further Development
- Implement more advanced NLP techniques, such as sentiment analysis using deep learning models or entity recognition with contextual embeddings.
- Explore additional features, such as dialogue analysis, stylistic analysis, or cross-referencing with external datasets.
- Develop a user interface or web application to make the project more accessible to a wider audience.
- Extend the analysis to other books in the Harry Potter series or different literary works to compare linguistic patterns and themes.

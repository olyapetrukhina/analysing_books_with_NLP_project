699	719	720	724	The man in the painting	691	" To the Prime Minister of Muggles . Urgent we meet . Kindly respond immediately . Sincerely , Fudge . "
732	735	737	739	the Prime Minister	651	" Er , "
741	768	737	739	the Prime Minister	651	" listen ... Its not a very good time for me ... I 'm waiting for a telephone call , you see ... from the President of-- "
769	775	782	784	The Prime Minister	651	" That can be rearranged , "
796	805	789	789	He	651	" But I really was rather hoping to speak-- "
806	825	827	829	the little man	695	" We shall arrange for the President to forget to call . He will telephone tomorrow night instead , "
831	839	827	829	the little man	695	" Kindly respond immediately to Mr. Fudge . "
840	848	850	852	the Prime Minister	651	" I ... oh ... very well , "
855	863	850	852	the Prime Minister	651	" Yes , I 'll see Fudge . "

1001	1008	991	992	Cornelius Fudge	139	" Good to see you again . "
1103	1110	1111	1111	he	651	" How can I help you ? "
1134	1142	1144	1144	Fudge	139	" Difficult to know where to begin , "
1163	1172	1144	1144	Fudge	139	" What a week , what a week ... "
1173	1183	1185	1187	the Prime Minister	651	" Had a bad one too , have you ? "
1211	1217	1219	1219	Fudge	139	" Yes , of course , "
1233	1267	1219	1219	Fudge	139	" I 've been having the same week you have , Prime Minister . The Brockdale Bridge ... the Bones and Vance murders ... not to mention the ruckus in the West Country ... "
1268	1297	1298	1298	Fudge	139	" You -- er -- your -- I mean to say , some of your people were -- were involved in those -- those things , were they ? "
1309	1315	1316	1316	he	139	" Of course they were , "
1319	1329	1316	1316	he	139	" Surely you 've realized what 's going on ? "
1330	1333	1335	1337	the Prime Minister	651	" I ... "
1668	1673	1674	1674	he	139	" Not to worry , "
1678	1770	1674	1674	he	139	" it 's odds - on you 'll never see me again . I 'll only bother you if there 's something really serious going on our end , something that 's likely to affect the Muggles -- the non - magical population , I should say . Otherwise , it 's live and let live . And I must say , you 're taking it a lot better than your predecessor . He tried to throw me out the window , thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition . "
1784	1794	1779	1779	his	651	" You're -- you're not a hoax , then ? "
1804	1807	1809	1809	Fudge	139	" No , "
1812	1824	1809	1809	Fudge	139	" No , I 'm afraid I 'm not . Look . "
1838	1841	1843	1845	the Prime Minister	651	" But , "
1860	1870	1843	1845	the Prime Minister	651	" but why -- why has nobody told me-- ? "
1871	1891	1893	1893	Fudge	139	" The Minister of Magic only reveals him -- or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day , "
1903	1914	1896	1896	his	139	" We find it the best way to maintain secrecy . "
1915	1919	1921	1923	the Prime Minister	651	" But then , "
1925	1936	1921	1923	the Prime Minister	651	" why has n't a former Prime Minister warned me-- ? "
1945	1959	1940	1940	Fudge	139	" My dear Prime Minister , are you ever going to tell anybody ? "
2361	2363	2358	2364	a man named " Serious " Black	743	" Serious "
2370	2373	2358	2364	a man named " Serious " Black	743	" Hogwarts , "
2393	2402	2403	2403	Fudge	139	" ... I 've just come from Azkaban , "
2425	2442	2403	2403	Fudge	139	" Middle of the North Sea , you know , nasty flight ... the dementors are in uproar"--he
2443	2497	2498	2498	He	139	shuddered--"they've never had a breakout before . Anyway , I had to come to you , Prime Minister . Black 's a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You - Know - Who .... But of course , you do n't even know who You - Know - Who is ! "
2513	2533	2498	2498	He	139	" Well , sit down , sit down , I 'd better fill you in ... Have a whiskey ... "
2661	2667	2668	2668	He	139	" So you think that ... "
2680	2683	2668	2668	He	139	" Lord Vol-- "
2684	2697	2699	2699	Fudge	139	" He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ! "
2701	2726	2699	2699	Fudge	139	" I 'm sorry ... You think that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named is still alive , then ? "
2727	2735	2737	2737	Fudge	139	" Well , Dumbledore says he is , "
2752	2815	2740	2740	he	139	" but we 've never found him . If you ask me , he 's not dangerous unless he 's got support , so it 's Black we ought to be worrying about . You 'll put out that warning , then ? Excellent . Well , I hope we do n't see each other again , Prime Minister ! Good night . "
2878	2881	2829	2833	a harassed - looking Fudge	754	" involved , "
2933	2941	2942	2942	Fudge	139	" Oh , and I almost forgot , "
2946	3001	2942	2942	Fudge	139	" We 're importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament , quite routine , but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that its down in the rule book that we have to notify you if we 're bringing highly dangerous creatures into the country . "
3002	3009	3011	3013	the Prime Minister	651	" I -- what -- dragons ? "
3015	3020	3022	3022	Fudge	139	" Yes , three , "
3024	3036	3022	3022	Fudge	139	" And a sphinx . Well , good day to you . "
3089	3094	3096	3098	the Prime Minister	651	" A mass breakout ? "
3101	3112	3114	3114	Fudge	139	" No need to worry , no need to worry ! "
3124	3142	3114	3114	Fudge	139	" We 'll have them rounded up in no time -- just thought you ought to know ! "
3151	3159	3160	3160	Fudge	139	" Now , wait just one moment ! "
3329	3346	3348	3350	the Prime Minister	651	" How should I know what 's going on in the -- er -- Wizarding community ? "
3353	3368	3348	3350	the Prime Minister	651	" I have a country to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without-- "
3369	3376	3377	3377	Fudge	139	" We have the same concerns , "
3380	3445	3377	3377	Fudge	139	" The Brock - dale Bridge did n't wear out . That was n't really a hurricane . Those murders were not the work of Muggles . And Herbert Chorley 's family would be safer without him . We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo 's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries . The move should be effected tonight . "
3446	3458	3460	3462	the Prime Minister	651	" What do you ... I 'm afraid I ... What ? "
3474	3506	3464	3464	Fudge	139	" Prime Minister , I am very sorry to have to tell you that he 's back . He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named is back . "
3507	3523	3464	3464	Fudge	139	" Back ? When you say ' back ' ... he 's alive ? I mean-- "
3575	3580	3582	3582	Fudge	139	" Yes , alive , "
3584	3652	3582	3582	Fudge	139	" That is -- I do n't know -- is a man alive if he ca n't be killed ? I do n't really understand it , and Dumbledore wo n't explain properly -- but anyway , he 's certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing , so I suppose , for the purposes of our discussion , yes , he 's alive . "
3697	3717	3725	3725	Fudge	139	" Is Serious Black with -- er -- He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named ? "
3718	3723	3725	3725	Fudge	139	" Black ? Black ? "
3736	3793	3794	3794	he	139	" Sirius Black , you mean ? Merlin 's beard , no . Black 's dead . Turns out we were -- er -- mistaken about Black . He was innocent after all . And he was n't in league with He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named either . I mean , "
3805	3853	3794	3794	he	139	" all the evidence pointed -- we had more than fifty eyewitnesses -- but anyway , as I say , he 's dead . Murdered , as a matter of fact . On Ministry of Magic premises . There 's going to be an inquiry , actually ... "
3943	3971	3940	3940	Fudge	139	" But Blacks by - the - by now . The point is , we 're at war , Prime Minister , and steps must be taken . "
3972	3976	3978	3980	the Prime Minister	651	" At war ? "
3983	3994	3978	3980	the Prime Minister	651	" Surely that 's a little bit of an overstatement ? "
3995	4024	4026	4026	Fudge	139	" He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January , "
4048	4087	4026	4026	Fudge	139	" Since they have moved into the open , they have been wreaking havoc . The Brockdale Bridge -- he did it , Prime Minister , he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and-- "
4088	4123	4125	4127	the Prime Minister	651	" Good grief , so it 's your fault those people were killed and I 'm having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I do n't know what else ! "
4130	4134	4136	4136	Fudge	139	" My fault ! "
4141	4155	4136	4136	Fudge	139	" Are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that ? "
4156	4160	4162	4164	the Prime Minister	651	" Maybe not , "
4174	4194	4162	4164	the Prime Minister	651	" but I would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity ! "
4195	4208	4210	4210	Fudge	139	" Do you really think I was n't already making every effort ? "
4213	4262	4210	4210	Fudge	139	" Every Auror in the Ministry was -- and is -- trying to find him and round up his followers , but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time , a wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades ! "
4263	4283	4285	4287	the Prime Minister	651	" So I suppose you 're going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too ? "
4332	4338	4340	4340	Fudge	139	" That was no hurricane , "
4343	4347	4340	4340	Fudge	139	" Excuse me ! "
4360	4373	4340	4340	Fudge	139	" Trees uprooted , roofs ripped off , lampposts bent , horrible injuries-- "
4374	4381	4383	4383	Fudge	139	" It was the Death Eaters , "
4385	4408	4383	4383	Fudge	139	" He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named 's followers . And ... and we suspect giant involvement . "
4425	4429	4430	4430	Fudge	139	" What involvement ? "
4433	4450	4451	4451	he	139	" He used giants last time , when he wanted to go for the grand effect , "
4454	4521	4451	4451	he	139	" The Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock , we 've had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw what really happened , we 've got most of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset , but we ca n't find the giant -- it 's been a disaster . "
4522	4528	4530	4532	the Prime Minister	651	" You do n't say ! "
4535	4549	4551	4551	Fudge	139	" I wo n't deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry , "
4553	4565	4551	4551	Fudge	139	" What with all that , and then losing Amelia Bones . "
4566	4570	4451	4451	he	139	" Losing who ? "
4571	4626	4627	4627	Fudge	139	" Amelia Bones . Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement . We think He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named may have murdered her in person , because she was a very gifted witch and -- and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight . "
4646	4655	4657	4659	the Prime Minister	651	" But that murder was in the newspapers , "
4667	4717	4718	4718	Fudge	139	" Our newspapers . Amelia Bones ... it just said she was a middle - aged woman who lived alone . It was a -- a nasty killing , was n't it ? It 's had rather a lot of publicity . The police are baffled , you see . "
4721	4729	4730	4730	he	139	" Well , of course they are , "
4733	4788	4730	4730	he	139	" Killed in a room that was locked from the inside , was n't she ? We , on the other hand , know exactly who did it , not that that gets us any further toward catching him . And then there was Emmeline Vance , maybe you did n't hear about that one-- "
4789	4795	4797	4799	the Prime Minister	651	" Oh yes I did ! "
4801	4839	4797	4799	the Prime Minister	651	" It happened just around the corner from here , as a matter of fact . The papers had a field day with it , ' breakdown of law and order in the Prime Minister 's backyard-- ' "
4840	4850	4852	4852	Fudge	139	" And as if all that was n't enough , "
4861	4881	4852	4852	Fudge	139	" we 've got dementors swarming all over the place , attacking people left , right , and center ... "
4904	4914	4915	4915	he	139	" I thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban , "
4919	4923	4925	4925	Fudge	139	" They did , "
4928	4962	4925	4925	Fudge	139	" But not anymore . They 've deserted the prison and joined He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named . I wo n't pretend that was n't a blow . "
4963	4966	4968	4970	the Prime Minister	651	" But , "
4979	4998	4968	4970	the Prime Minister	651	" did n't you tell me they 're the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people ? "
4999	5018	5019	5021	The Prime Minister	651	" That 's right . And they 're breeding . That 's what 's causing all this mist . "
5059	5081	4968	4970	the Prime Minister	651	" Now see here , Fudge -- you've got to do something ! It 's your responsibility as Minister of Magic ! "
5082	5138	5140	5140	Fudge	139	" My dear Prime Minister , you ca n't honestly think I 'm still Minister of Magic after all this ? I was sacked three days ago ! The whole Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight . I 've never known them so united in my whole term of office ! "
5186	5192	5193	5193	he	651	" I 'm very sorry , "
5197	5206	5193	5193	he	651	" If there 's anything I can do ? "
5207	5273	5274	5274	Fudge	139	" It 's very kind of you , Prime Minister , but there is nothing . I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor . I rather thought he 'd be here by now , but of course , he 's very busy at the moment , with so much going on . "
5314	5332	5193	5193	he	651	" He 'll be here in a moment , he 's just finishing a letter to Dumbledore . "
5333	5339	5341	5341	Fudge	139	" I wish him luck , "
5350	5396	5341	5341	Fudge	139	" I 've been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight , but he wo n't budge . If he 'd just been prepared to persuade the boy , I might still be ... Well , maybe Scrimgeour will have more success . "
5427	5452	5462	5464	the Prime Minister	651	" To the Prime Minister of Muggles . Requesting a meeting . Urgent . Kindly respond immediately . Rufus Scrimgeour , Minister of Magic . "
5453	5460	5462	5464	the Prime Minister	651	" Yes , yes , fine , "
5638	5644	5646	5648	the Prime Minister	651	" How do you do ? "
5677	5683	5684	5684	he	148	" Fudge told you everything ? "
5708	5713	5715	5717	the Prime Minister	651	" Er -- yes , "
5719	5735	5715	5717	the Prime Minister	651	" And if you do n't mind , I 'd rather that door remained unlocked . "
5736	5744	5746	5746	Scrimgeour	148	" I 'd rather not be interrupted , "
5749	5753	5754	5754	he	148	" or watched , "
5772	5802	5754	5754	he	148	" Right , well , I 'm a busy man , so let 's get down lo business . First of all , we need to discuss your security . "
5816	5832	5807	5807	himself	651	" I am perfectly happy with the security I 've already got , thank you very-- "
5833	5840	5841	5841	Scrimgeour	148	" Well , we 're not , "
5845	5873	5841	5841	Scrimgeour	148	" It 'll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse . The new secretary in your outer office-- "
5874	5892	5894	5896	the Prime Minister	651	" I 'm not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt , if that 's what you 're suggesting ! "
5899	5914	5894	5896	the Prime Minister	651	" He 's highly efficient , gets through twice the work the rest of them-- "
5915	5924	5926	5926	Scrimgeour	148	" That 's because he 's a wizard , "
5935	5951	5926	5926	Scrimgeour	148	" A highly trained Auror , who has been assigned to you for your protection . "
5952	5959	5961	5963	the Prime Minister	651	" Now , wait a moment ! "
5965	5983	5961	5963	the Prime Minister	651	" You ca n't just put your people into my office , I decide who works for me-- "
5984	5993	5995	5995	Scrimgeour	148	" I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt ? "
5998	6009	5995	5995	Scrimgeour	148	" I am -- that 's to say , I was-- "
6010	6020	6022	6022	Scrimgeour	148	" Then there 's no problem , is there ? "
6024	6043	6045	6047	the Prime Minister	651	" I ... well , as long as Shacklebolt 's work continues to be ... er ... excellent , "
6058	6069	6070	6070	he	651	" Now , about Herbert Chorley , your Junior Minister , "
6073	6087	6070	6070	he	651	" The one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck . "
6088	6093	6095	6097	the Prime Minister	651	" What about him ? "
6099	6111	6113	6113	Scrimgeour	148	" He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse , "
6115	6129	6113	6113	Scrimgeour	148	" It 's addled his brains , but he could still be dangerous . "
6130	6136	6138	6140	the Prime Minister	651	" He 's only quacking ! "
6143	6158	6138	6140	the Prime Minister	651	" Surely a bit of a rest ... Maybe go easy on the drink ... "
6159	6192	6194	6194	Scrimgeour	148	" A team of Healers from St. Mungo 's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak . So far he has attempted to strangle three of them , "
6196	6212	6194	6194	Scrimgeour	148	" I think it best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while . "
6213	6228	6230	6232	the Prime Minister	651	" I ... well ... He 'll be all right , wo n't he ? "
6246	6304	6235	6235	Scrimgeour	148	" Well , that 's really all I had to say . I will keep you posted of developments , Prime Minister -- or , at least , I shall probably be too busy to come personally , in which case I shall send Fudge here . He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity . "
6371	6396	6367	6367	him	651	" But for heaven 's sake -- you're wizards ! You can do magic ! Surely you can sort out -- well -- anything ! "
6424	6440	6420	6420	he	139	" The trouble is , the other side can do magic too , Prime Minister . "
6639	6642	6634	6636	another hooded figure	837	" Wait ! "
6702	6707	6709	6710	a woman	840	" Just a fox , "
6719	6730	6709	6710	a woman	840	" I thought perhaps an Auror -- Cissy , wait ! "
6760	6768	6769	6771	The second woman	842	" Cissy -- Narcissa -- listen to me-- "
6787	6793	6781	6782	the other	844	" Go back , Bella ! "
6794	6801	6781	6782	the other	844	" You must listen to me ! "
6802	6818	6819	6822	The woman named Narcissa	845	" I 've listened already . I 've made my decision . Leave me alone ! "
6884	6889	6891	6891	Bella	153	" He lives here ? "
6898	6918	6891	6891	Bella	153	" Here ? In this Muggle dunghill ? We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot-- "
6943	6948	6925	6925	she	152	" Cissy , wait ! "
7029	7043	7004	7004	she	860	" Cissy , you must not do this , you ca n't trust him-- "
7044	7055	7080	7080	she	153	" The Dark Lord trusts him , does n't he ? "
7056	7067	7068	7068	Bella	153	" The Dark Lord is ... I believe ... mistaken , "
7091	7116	7080	7080	she	153	" In any case , we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone . This is a betrayal of the Dark Lord's-- "
7117	7123	7125	7125	Narcissa	152	" Let go , Bella ! "
7150	7159	7146	7146	Bella	153	" Cissy , your own sister ? You wouldn't-- "
7160	7170	7171	7171	Narcissa	152	" There is nothing I would n't do anymore ! "
7212	7215	7200	7200	Bella	153	" Narcissa ! "
7438	7441	7443	7444	the man	874	" Narcissa ! "
7465	7471	7443	7444	the man	874	" What a pleasant surprise ! "
7474	7482	7472	7472	Severus	156	" she said in a strained whisper . "
7493	7494	7484	7484	I	0	" "
7499	7522	7523	7523	Snape	156	" He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house . Her still - hooded sister followed without invitation . "
7525	7534	7523	7523	Snape	156	" she said curtly as she passed him . "
7537	7722	7535	7535	Bellatrix	157	" he replied , his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them . They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room , which had the feeling of a dark , padded cell . The walls were completely covered in books , most of them bound in old black or brown leather ; a threadbare sofa , an old armchair , and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle - filled lamp hung from the ceiling . The place had an air of neglect , as though it was not usually inhabited . Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa . She threw off her cloak , cast it aside , and sat down , staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap . Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly . Dark as her sister was fair , with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw , she did not take her gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind Narcissa . "
7732	7746	7727	7727	I	0	" Snape asked , settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters . "
7757	7784	7785	7785	He	0	" Narcissa asked quietly . ' Yes , of course . Well , Wormtail 's here , but we 're not counting vermin , are we ? "
7819	7832	7834	7834	Snape	156	" As you have clearly realized , Wormtail , we have guests , "
7892	7895	7896	7896	he	874	" Narcissa ! "
7904	7910	7896	7896	he	874	" And Bellatrix ! How charming-- "
7911	7924	7926	7926	Snape	156	" Wormtail will get us drinks , if you 'd like them , "
7928	7938	7926	7926	Snape	156	" And then he will return to his bedroom . "
7950	7957	7958	7958	he	158	" I am not your servant ! "
7966	7985	7958	7958	he	158	" Really ? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me . "
7986	8005	7943	7943	Snape	156	" To assist , yes -- but not to make you drinks and -- and clean your house ! "
8006	8022	8024	8024	Snape	156	" I had no idea , Wormtail , that you were craving more dangerous assignments , "
8027	8041	8024	8024	Snape	156	" This can be easily arranged : I shall speak to the Dark Lord-- "
8042	8054	7943	7943	Snape	156	" I can speak to him myself if I want to ! "
8055	8061	8063	8063	Snape	156	" Of course you can , "
8067	8087	8063	8063	Snape	156	" But in the meantime , bring us drinks . Some of the elf - made wine will do . "
8213	8218	8219	8219	he	158	" The Dark Lord , "
8251	8281	8245	8245	she	152	" Severus , I 'm sorry to come here like this , but I had to see you . I think you are the only one who can help me-- "
8323	8327	8329	8329	Snape	156	" My apologies , "
8331	8357	8329	8329	Snape	156	" He has lately taken to listening at doors , I do n't know what he means by it ... You were saying , Narcissa ? "
8369	8392	8358	8358	She	152	" Severus , I know I ought not to be here , I have been told to say nothing to anyone , but-- "
8393	8402	8404	8404	Bellatrix	157	" Then you ought to hold your tongue ! "
8406	8412	8404	8404	Bellatrix	157	" Particularly in present company ! "
8414	8419	8421	8421	Snape	156	" Present company ' ? "
8424	8436	8421	8421	Snape	156	" And what urn I to understand by that , Bellatrix ? "
8437	8453	8454	8454	Narcissa	152	" That I do n't trust you , Snape , as you very well know ! "
8503	8531	8533	8533	Snape	156	" Narcissa , I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to say ; it will save tedious interruptions . Well , continue , Bellatrix , "
8535	8546	8533	8533	Snape	156	" Why is it that you do not trust me ? "
8547	8552	8553	8553	she	157	" A hundred reasons ! "
8571	8685	8686	8686	She	885	" Where to start ! Where were you when the Dark Lord fell ? Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished ? What have you been doing all these years that you 've lived in Dumbledore 's pocket ? Why did you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerer 's Stone ? Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn ? Where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord ? And why , Snape , is Harry Potter still alive , when you have had him at your mercy for five years ? "
8721	8827	8718	8718	Snape	156	" Before I answer you — oh yes , Bellatrix , I am going to answer ! You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back , and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord ! Before I answer you , I say , let me ask a question in turn . Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions ? And do you really think that , had I not been able to give satisfactory answers , I would be sitting here talking to you ? "
8831	8842	8718	8718	Snape	156	" I know he believes you , but . . . "
8843	8877	8878	8878	Bellatrix	157	" You think he is mistaken ? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him ? Fooled the Dark Lord , the greatest wizard , the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen ? "
8914	8976	8901	8901	He	156	" You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell . I was where he had ordered me to be , at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry , because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore . You know , I presume , that it was on the Dark Lord 's orders that I took up the post ? "
8992	9022	9024	9024	he	156	" You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished . For the same reason that Avery , Yaxley , the Carrows , Greyback , Lucius "
9032	9086	9024	9024	he	156	" and many others did not attempt to find him . I believed him finished . I am not proud of it , I was wrong , but there it is . ... If he had not forgiven we who lost faith at that time , he would have very few followers left . "
9087	9093	9095	9095	Bellatrix	157	" He 'd have me ! "
9098	9110	9095	9095	Bellatrix	157	" I , who spent many years in Azkaban for him ! "
9111	9119	9121	9121	Snape	156	" Yes , indeed , most admirable , "
9127	9151	9121	9121	Snape	156	" Of i nurse , you were n't a lot of use to him in prison , but the gesture was undoubtedly fine — "
9152	9155	9156	9156	she	157	" Gesture ! "
9167	9185	9160	9160	her	157	" While I endured the dementors , you remained at Hogwarts , comfortably playing Dumbledore 's pet ! "
9186	9190	9192	9192	Snape	156	" Not quite , "
9195	9234	9192	9192	Snape	156	" He would n't give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job , you know . Seemed to think it might , ah , bring about a relapse , . . tempt me into my old ways . "
9235	9252	9253	9253	she	157	" This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord , not to teach your favorite subject ? "
9256	9279	9253	9253	she	157	" Why did you stay there all that time , Snape ? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed dead ? "
9280	9283	9285	9285	Snape	156	" Hardly , "
9287	9336	9285	9285	Snape	156	" although the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post : I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned , a rather more useful welcome - back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is . . . . "
9337	9342	9353	9353	Snape	156	" But you stayed — "
9343	9351	9353	9353	Snape	156	" Yes , Bellatrix , I stayed , "
9365	9431	9353	9353	Snape	156	" I had a comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban . They were rounding up the Death Eaters , you know . Dumbledore 's protection kept me out of jail ; it was most convenient and I used it . I repeat : The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed , so I do not see why you do . "
9440	9457	9434	9434	you	887	" he pressed on a little more loudly , for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting , "
9596	9612	9587	9587	I	0	" Bellatrix 's mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine . "
9640	9641	9623	9623	you	0	" "
9657	9658	9650	9650	I	0	" "
9664	9673	9660	9660	Dumbledore	146	" she began , in tones of outrage . "
9676	9683	9660	9660	Dumbledore	146	" said Snape , impatient again . "
9805	9856	9867	9867	Bellatrix	157	" The Dark Lord 's initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely , 1 assure you , when I explained that 1 remained faithful , although Dumbledore thought I was his man . Yes , the Dark Lord thought that I had left him forever , but he was wrong . "
9857	9865	9867	9867	Bellatrix	157	" But what use have you been ? "
9869	9879	9867	9867	Bellatrix	157	" What useful information have we had from you ? "
9880	9892	9894	9894	Snape	156	" My information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord , "
9896	9907	9894	9894	Snape	156	" If he chooses not to share it with you — "
9908	9915	9917	9917	Bellatrix	157	" He shares everything with me ! "
9924	9936	9917	9917	Bellatrix	157	" He calls me his most loyal , his most faithful — "
9937	9941	9943	9943	Snape	156	" Does he ? "
9954	9966	9945	9945	his	156	" Does he still , after the fiasco at the Ministry ? "
9967	9974	9976	9976	Bellatrix	157	" That was not my fault ! "
9980	10002	9976	9976	Bellatrix	157	" The Dark Lord has , in the past , entrusted me with his most precious — if Lucius had n't — "
10003	10017	10019	10019	Narcissa	152	" Do n't you dare — do n't you dare blame my husband ! "
10034	10042	10044	10044	Snape	156	" There is no point apportioning blame , "
10047	10055	10044	10044	Snape	156	" What is done , is done . "
10056	10062	10064	10064	Bellatrix	157	" But not by you ! "
10067	10089	10064	10064	Bellatrix	157	" No , you were once again absent while the rest of us ran dangers , were you not , Snape ? "
10090	10098	10100	10100	Snape	156	" My orders were to remain behind , "
10102	10159	10100	10100	Snape	156	" Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord , perhaps you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoenix ? And — forgive me — you speak of dangers . . . you were facing six teenagers , were you not ? "
10160	10179	10181	10181	Bellatrix	157	" They were joined , as you very well know , by half of the Order before long ! "
10183	10213	10181	10181	Bellatrix	157	" And , while we are on the subject of the Order , you still claim you can not reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters , do n't you ? "
10214	10298	10299	10299	He	899	" I am not the Secret - Keeper ; I can not speak the name of the place . You understand how the enchantment works , I think ? The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on the Order . It led , as perhaps you have guessed , to the recent capture and murder of Emmeline Vance , and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black , though I give you full credit for finishing him off . "
10313	10348	10307	10307	Her	900	" You are avoiding my last question , Snape . Harry Potter . You could have killed him at any point in the past five years . You have not done it . Why ? "
10349	10360	10362	10362	Snape	156	" Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord ? "
10364	10380	10362	10362	Snape	156	" He . . . lately , we ... I am asking you , Snape ! "
10381	10405	10307	10307	Her	900	" If I had murdered Harry Potter , the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate , making him invincible — "
10406	10417	10418	10418	she	901	" You claim you foresaw his use of the boy ! "
10421	10475	10418	10418	she	901	" I do not claim it ; I had no idea of his plans ; I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead . I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived , at least until a year ago . . . . "
10476	10485	10307	10307	Her	900	" But why did you keep him alive ? "
10486	10622	10418	10418	she	901	" Have you not understood me ? It was only Dumbledore 's protection that was keeping me out of Azkaban ! Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me ? But there was more to it than that . I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circulating about him , rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard , which was how he had survived the Dark Lord 's attack . Indeed , many of the Dark Lords old followers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more . I was curious , 1 admit it , and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set fool in the castle . "
10738	10739	10733	10733	Dumbledore	146	" "
10755	10759	10760	10760	He	146	" asked Bellatrix . "
10775	10776	10769	10769	he	146	" "
10784	10788	10769	10769	he	146	" said Snape . "
10866	10877	10878	10880	the Dark Lord	154	" ( for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise ) , "
10951	10980	10947	10949	the Dark Lord	154	" Bellatrix still looked unhappy , though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next . Taking advantage of her silence , Snape turned to her sister . "
10995	11008	10985	10985	you	909	" Narcissa looked up at him , her face eloquent with despair . "
11042	11057	11034	11034	Lucius	164	" She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her eyelids . "
11069	11078	11079	11079	He	154	" Narcissa continued , her eyes still closed . "
11096	11097	11099	11099	he	154	" "
11110	11116	11099	11099	he	154	" said Snape at once . "
11125	11152	11118	11119	Dark Lord	154	" Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water . Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house . "
11155	11163	11099	11099	he	154	" she said triumphantly to her sister . "
11181	11222	11165	11165	Snape	156	" But Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window , peered through the curtains at the deserted street , then closed them again with a jerk . He turned around to face Narcissa , frowning . "
11233	11241	11227	11227	I	0	" he said in a low voice . "
11280	11281	11282	11282	I	0	" "
11290	11298	11284	11284	you	0	" said Narcissa , breathing more freely . "
11307	11308	11309	11309	You	0	" "
11315	11331	11332	11332	You	0	" said Bellatrix , her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage . "
11335	11336	11332	11332	You	0	" "
11339	11343	11332	11332	You	0	" said Snape . "
11382	11383	11384	11384	Severus	156	" "
11386	11397	11384	11384	Severus	156	" she whispered , tears sliding down her pale cheeks . "
11409	11410	11384	11384	Severus	156	" "
11416	11421	11384	11384	Severus	156	" said Bellatrix indifferently . "
11464	11480	11449	11449	he	170	" Narcissa began to cry in earnest , gazing beseechingly all the while at Snape . "
11521	11551	11512	11513	lor Lucius	164	" Snape said nothing . He looked away from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent , but he could not pretend not to hear her . "
11564	11568	11558	11558	Draco	170	" she persisted . "
11573	11574	11558	11558	Draco	170	" "
11579	11589	11558	11558	Draco	170	" said Snape , still looking away from her , "
11598	11599	11558	11558	Draco	170	" "
11606	11610	11613	11613	he	170	" sobbed Narcissa . "
11622	11633	11613	11613	he	170	" Bellatrix gasped ; Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve . "
11713	11714	11704	11704	you	156	" "
11733	11738	11739	11739	I	0	" said Snape flatly . "
11796	11797	11784	11786	the Dark Lord	4469	" "
11810	11814	11815	11815	He	4469	" choked Narcissa . "
11831	11881	11882	11882	You	924	" When Snape said nothing , Narcissa seemed to lose what little self - restraint she still possessed . Standing up , she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his robes . Her face close to his , her tears falling onto his chest , she gasped , "
11916	11940	11907	11907	he	170	" Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands . Looking down into her tearstained face , he said slowly , "
11994	11995	11964	11964	You	926	" "
12011	12012	12013	12015	The Dark Lord	154	" "
12020	12025	12026	12026	He	170	" repeated Snape quietly . "
12050	12066	12044	12044	he	170	" She crumpled , falling at his feet , sobbing and moaning on the floor . "
12079	12080	12044	12044	he	170	" "
12086	12091	12081	12081	You	0	" said Bellatrix ruthlessly . "
12113	12164	12165	12165	Narcissa	152	" Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair . Snape stooped , seized her by the arms , lifted her up , and steered her back onto the sofa . He then poured her more wine and forced the glass into her hand . "
12178	12195	12176	12176	me	0	" She quieted a little ; slopping wine down herself , she took a shaky sip . "
12207	12222	12223	12223	Severus	156	" She sat up , her face paper - white , her eyes huge . "
12247	12248	12249	12249	I	0	" "
12253	12295	12249	12249	I	0	" She flung away her glass ; it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at Snape 's feet , seized his hand in both of hers , and pressed her lips to it . "
12320	12321	12314	12314	you	156	" "
12326	12347	12314	12314	you	156	" Snape 's expression was blank , unreadable . Bellatrix , however , let out a cackle of triumphant laughter . "
12394	12423	12385	12387	the Dark Lord	4469	" Snape did not look at Bellatrix . His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissa 's tear - filled blue ones as she continued to clutch his hand . "
12435	12440	12428	12428	I	0	" he said quietly . "
12451	12480	12481	12481	You	152	" Bellatrix 's mouth fell open . Snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite Narcissa . Beneath Bellatrix 's astonished gaze , they grasped right hands . "
12489	12502	12487	12487	Bellatrix	157	" said Snape coldly . She drew it , still looking astonished . "
12513	12542	12504	12504	you	152	" he said . She stepped forward so that she stood over them , and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands . Narcissa spoke . "
12566	12567	12568	12568	I	0	" "
12571	12599	12568	12568	I	0	" said Snape . A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a red - hot wire . "
12616	12617	12618	12618	I	0	" "
12621	12647	12618	12618	I	0	" said Snape . A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first , making a fine , glowing chain . "
12664	12683	12685	12685	you	152	" whispered Narcissa ( Snape 's hand twitched within hers , but he did not draw away ) , "
12700	12722	12723	12723	I	0	" There was a moment 's silence . Bellatrix watched , her wand upon their clasped hands , her eyes wide . "
12726	12774	12723	12723	I	0	" said Snape . Bellatrix 's astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third unique of flame , which shot from the wand , twisted with the others , and bound itself thickly around their clasped hands , like a rope , like a fiery snake .

13524	14248	13520	13522	Mrs. Augusta Longbottom	173	" My grandson , Neville — a good friend of Harry Potter 's , incidentally , who fought the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in June and — But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage .standing on top of it . Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl . Her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously , her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master . Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently , but Harry was too deeply asleep to hear her . A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room . Its lid was open ; it looked expectant ; yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear , sweets , empty ink bottles , and broken quills that coated the very bottom . Nearby , on the floor , lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the words : ----ISSUED ON BEHALF OF---- The Ministry of Magic PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY AGAINST DARK FORCES The Wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the Death Eaters . Observing the following simple security guidelines will help protect you , your family , and your home from attack . 1 . You are advised not to leave the house alone . 2 . Particular care should be taken during the hours of darkness . Wherever possible , arrange to complete journeys before night has fallen . 3 . Review the security arrangements around your house , making sure that all family members are aware of emergency measures such as Shield and Disillusionment Charms , and , in the case of underage family members , Side - Along - Apparition . 4 . Agree on security questions with close friends and family so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading as others by use of the Polyjuice Potion ( see page 2 ) . 5 . Should you feel that a family member , colleague , friend , or neighbor is acting in a strange manner , contact the Magical Law Enforcement Squad at once . They may have been put under the Imperius Curse ( see page 4 ) . 6 . Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling place or other building , DO NOT ENTER , but contact the Auror office immediately . 7 . Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death Eaters may now be using Inferi ( see page 10 ) . Any sighting of an Inferius , or encounter with same , should be reported to the Ministry IMMEDIATELY . Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so , making his glasses still more lopsided , but he did not wake up . An alarm clock , repaired by Harry several years ago , ticked loudly on the sill , showing one minute to eleven . Beside it , held in place by Harry 's relaxed hand , was a piece of parchment covered in thin , slanting writing . Harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll , it now lay quite flat . Dear Harry , If it is convenient to you , I shall call at number four , Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p.m. to escort you to the Burrow , where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays . If you are agreeable , I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the . Burrow . I shall explain this more fully when I see you . Kindly send your answer by return of this owl . Hoping to see you this Friday , I am , yours most sincerely , Albus Dumbledore Though he already knew it by heart , Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o'clock that evening , when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window , which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive . He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledore 's words ; Harry had sent back his "
14250	14564	14794	14794	Harry	136	" with the delivering owl , as requested , and all he could do now was wait : Either Dumbledore was going to come , or he was not . But Harry had not packed . It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company . He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong — his reply to Dumbledore 's letter might have gone astray ; Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him ; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all , but a trick or joke or trap . Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again . The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl , Hedwig , safely in her cage . The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and , at that precise moment , the street - lamp outside the window went out . Harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm . Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass , he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement . A tall figure in a long , billowing cloak was walking up the garden path . Harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock , knocked over his chair , and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk . Even as he lobbed a set of robes , two spellbooks , and a packet of crisps across the room , the doorbell rang . Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted , "
14576	14637	14794	14794	Harry	136	" Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other . He had completely forgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming . Feeling both panicky mid close to laughter , he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say , "
14660	14785	14649	14649	Harry	136	" Harry ran down the stairs two at a time , coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom , as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm 's reach of his uncle whenever possible . There in the doorway stood a tall , thin man with waist - length silver hair and beard . Half - moon spectacles were perched on his crooked nose , and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and .1 pointed hat . Vernon Dursley , whose mustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledore 's , though black , and who was wearing a puce dressing gown , was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes . "
14804	14809	14794	14794	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore pleasantly . "
14838	14853	14816	14816	you	977	" He stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him . "
14864	14877	14878	14878	I	0	" said Dumbledore , peering down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon . "
14887	14973	14878	14878	I	0	" Vernon Dursley said nothing at all . Harry did not doubt that speech would return to him , and soon — the vein pulsing in his uncles temple was reaching danger point — but something about Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath . It might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance , but it might , too , have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully . "
14980	15000	14978	14978	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore , looking up at him through his half - moon glasses with a most satisfied expression . "
15005	15034	14978	14978	Harry	136	" These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon . It was clear that as far as he was concerned , any man who could look at Harry and say "
15036	15050	15051	15051	I	0	" was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye . "
15059	15073	15051	15051	I	0	" he began , in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable . "
15084	15091	15051	15051	I	0	" Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely . "
15111	15161	15109	15109	Petunia	182	" The kitchen door had opened , and there stood Harry 's aunt , wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress , clearly halfway through her usual pre - bedtime wipe - down of all the kitchen surfaces . Her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock . "
15165	15178	15162	15163	Albus Dumbledore	146	" said Dumbledore , when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction . "
15186	15216	15179	15179	We	982	" Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter , but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term . "
15226	15296	15224	15224	Dudley	183	" Dudley had that moment peered round the living room door . His large , blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied , his mouth gaping in astonishment and I car . Dumbledore waited a moment or two , apparently to see whether any of the Dursleys were going to say anything , but as the ? .ilcncc stretched on he smiled . "
15310	15371	15301	15301	you	0	" Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him . Harry , still clutching the telescope and trainers , jumped the last few stairs and followed Dumbledore , who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest . He looked quite extraordinarily out of place . "
15383	15388	15392	15392	we	982	" Harry asked anxiously . "
15407	15411	15413	15413	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
15439	15440	15445	15445	you	0	" "
15447	15467	15445	15445	you	0	" Vernon Dursley had entered the room , Petunia at his shoulder , and Dudley skulking behind them both . "
15470	15475	15476	15476	I	0	" said Dumbledore simply , "
15479	15538	15539	15539	We	982	" He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it ; with a casual flick , the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap . Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position . "
15546	15581	15582	15582	Sir	985	" said Dumbledore pleasantly . As he replaced his wand in his pocket , Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled ; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away . "
15590	15591	15594	15594	Harry	136	" "
15596	15600	15594	15594	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore . "
15605	15626	15594	15594	Harry	136	" Harry took the remaining armchair , choosing not to look at the Dursleys , who seemed stunned into silence . "
15639	15646	15631	15631	you	136	" Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon , "
15664	15712	15713	15714	Madam Rosmerta	184	" A third twitch of the wand , and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair . The bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honey - colored liquid into each of the glasses , which then floated to each person in the room . "
15722	15804	15713	15714	Madam Rosmerta	184	" said Dumbledore , raising his glass to Harry , who caught hold of his own and sipped . He had never tasted anything like it before , but enjoyed it immensely . The Dursleys , after quick , scared looks at one another , tried to ignore their glasses completely , a difficult feat , as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads . Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself . "
15809	15817	15807	15807	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore , turning toward him , "
15871	15901	15864	15864	he	144	" Over on the sofa , Uncle Vernon ’s head turned , but Harry did not look at him , nor could he think of anything to say except , "
15906	15907	15864	15864	he	144	" "
15918	15923	15924	15924	You	136	" Dumbledore went on . "
15955	15956	15957	15957	His	144	" "
15962	16005	16006	16006	He	144	" said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa . Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him . The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernon ’s head ; he attempted to beat it away . "
16013	16014	16010	16011	His godfather	990	" "
16017	16035	16010	16011	His godfather	990	" said Dumbledore . He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in the Dursleys . "
16039	16053	16010	16011	His godfather	990	" he continued to Harry , as if there had been no interruption , "
16066	16067	16056	16056	Sirius	144	" "
16075	16091	16056	16056	Sirius	144	" said Uncle Vernon greedily , his small eyes narrowing , but nobody answered him . "
16100	16104	16105	16105	I	0	" said Harry . "
16122	16173	16115	16115	I	0	" Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve , Grimmauld Place again if he could help it . He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone , imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave . "
16178	16182	16115	16115	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
16193	16194	16183	16183	We	997	" "
16197	16198	16183	16183	We	997	" "
16201	16228	16229	16229	Black	144	" said Dumbledore , ignoring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon , who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead , "
16323	16354	16355	16355	I	0	" A vivid image of the shrieking , spitting portrait of Sirius 's mother that hung in the hall of number twelve , Grimmauld Place flashed into Harry 's mind . "
16360	16364	16355	16355	I	0	" he said . "
16367	16371	16355	16355	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
16408	16445	16402	16403	his cousin	1009	" Without realizing what he was doing , Harry sprang to his feet ; the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor . Bellatrix Lestrange , Sirius 's killer , inherit his house ? "
16448	16452	16402	16403	his cousin	1009	" he said . "
16467	16472	16460	16460	she	157	" said Dumbledore calmly . "
16543	16544	16548	16548	you	1011	" "
16561	16562	16548	16548	you	1011	" "
16565	16569	16548	16548	you	1011	" said Dumbledore , "
16576	16602	16548	16548	you	1011	" He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair , but before he could do anything else , Uncle Vernon shouted , "
16612	16646	16604	16604	you	1011	" Harry looked around ; all three of the Dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls , their contents flying everywhere . "
16654	16671	16604	16604	you	1011	" said Dumbledore politely , and he raised his wand again . -All three glasses vanished . "
16686	16729	16730	16730	You	1011	" It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts , but he merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing , keeping his small piggy eyes on Dumbledore 's wand . "
16733	16752	16730	16730	You	1011	" Dumbledore said , turning back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered , "
16766	16880	16761	16761	you	1011	" He flicked his wand for a fifth time . There was a loud crack , and a house - elf appeared , with a snout for a nose , giant bat 's ears , and enormous bloodshot eyes , crouching on the Dursleys ' shag carpet and covered in grimy rags . Aunt Petunia let out a hair - raising shriek ; nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory . Dudley drew his large , bare , pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head , as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers , and Uncle Vernon bellowed , "
16887	16888	16761	16761	you	1011	" "
16891	16895	16889	16889	Kreacher	186	" finished Dumbledore . "
16908	16933	16934	16935	K readier	187	" croaked the house - elf , quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon , stamping his long , gnarled feet and pulling his ears . "
16975	16976	16982	16982	Harry	136	" "
16984	16995	16982	16982	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore loudly , over Kreacher 's continued croaks of "
17005	17006	16982	16982	Harry	136	" "
17019	17020	17007	17007	Kreacher	186	" "
17026	17043	17021	17021	I	0	" said Harry again , looking with disgust at the writhing , stamping house - elf . "
17050	17051	17044	17044	I	0	" "
17064	17065	17044	17044	I	0	" "
17100	17101	17044	17044	I	0	" "
17114	17157	17044	17044	I	0	" Harry stared at Dumbledore . He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange , but the idea of owning him , of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed Sirius , was repugnant . "
17163	17167	17044	17044	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
17203	17204	17044	17044	I	0	" "
17216	17236	17237	17237	Kreacher	186	" Kreacher 's voice had risen to a scream . Harry could think of nothing to say , except , "
17242	17315	17237	17237	Kreacher	186	" It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke . He grabbed his throat , his mouth still working furiously , his eyes bulging . After a few seconds of frantic gulping , he threw himself face forward onto the carpet ( Aunt Petunia whimpered ) and beat the floor with his hands and feet , giving himself over to a violent , but entirely silent , tantrum . "
17322	17327	17237	17237	Kreacher	186	" said Dumbledore cheerfully . "
17353	17354	17338	17338	You	1022	" "
17367	17381	17338	17338	You	1022	" Harry asked , aghast , us Kreacher thrashed around at his feet . "
17390	17394	17384	17384	you	0	" said Dumbledore . "
17431	17432	17419	17423	the other house - elves	1025	" "
17435	17441	17419	17423	the other house - elves	1025	" said Harry in relief , "
17473	17512	17453	17453	I	0	" Kreacher , who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air , gave Harry one upside - down look of deepest loathing and , with another loud crack , vanished . "
17515	17519	17453	17453	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
17559	17560	17551	17551	you	1030	" "
17563	17569	17551	17551	you	1030	" said Harry at once , "
17583	17584	17578	17578	Buckbeak	189	" "
17590	17596	17597	17597	He	190	" said Dumbledore , smiling . "
17658	17662	17651	17651	Harry	136	" Erm . .. "
17670	17675	17676	17676	I	0	" Dumbledore suggested shrewdly . "
17687	17844	17845	17845	Professor	146	" said Harry hastily , hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers . It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he needed ; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed , screwed the top back on his jar of color - change ink , and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron . Then , heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Hedwig 's cage in the other , he made his way back downstairs , He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the hall , which meant that he had to return to the living room . Nobody was talking . Dumbledore was humming quietly , apparently quite at his ease , but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard , and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said , "
17852	17853	17847	17847	I	0	" "
17856	17860	17847	17847	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
17868	17880	17847	17847	I	0	" And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more . "
17898	17899	17889	17889	Harry	136	" "
17902	17917	17889	17889	Harry	136	" said Aunt Petunia , speaking for the first time since Dumbledore 's arrival . "
17922	17927	17918	17918	I	0	" said Dumbledore politely . "
17954	17955	17943	17943	Dudders	191	" "
17958	17963	17943	17943	Dudders	191	" said Dumbledore pleasantly , "
17977	17982	17943	17943	Dudders	191	" Uncle Vernon muttered , "
17985	17991	17943	17943	Dudders	191	" but Dumbledore ignored him , "
18085	18127	18128	18128	You	146	" Dumbledore paused , and although his voice remained light and calm , and he gave no obvious sign of anger , Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together . "
18185	18209	18210	18210	Us	1042	" Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinctively , as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between them . "
18219	18246	18210	18210	Us	1042	" began Uncle Vernon furiously , but Dumbledore raised his ringer for silence , a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb . "
18356	18407	18410	18410	Harry	136	" None of the Dursleys said anything . Dudley was frowning slightly , as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated . Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat ; Aunt Petunia , however , was oddly flushed . "
18421	18436	18410	18410	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore at last , standing up and straightening his long black cloak . "
18442	18477	18410	18410	Harry	136	" he said to the Dursleys , who looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned , and after doffing his hat , he swept from the room . "
18480	18507	18410	18410	Harry	136	" said Harry hastily to the Dursleys , and followed Dumbledore , who paused beside Harry 's trunk , upon which Hedwig 's cage was perched . "
18520	18530	18531	18531	I	0	" he said , pulling out his wand again . "
18561	18627	18545	18545	I	0	" Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty , trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within . When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket , Dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk , cage , and Hedwig vanished . Dumbledore then waved his wand again , and the front door opened onto cool , misty darkness . "
18648	18648	18642	18644	that flighty temptress	1053	"
18777	18787	18788	18788	he	146	" Keep your wand at the ready , Harry , "
18792	18808	18788	18788	he	146	" But I thought I 'm not allowed to use magic outside school , sir ? "
18809	18816	18818	18818	Dumbledore	146	" If there is an attack , "
18820	18851	18818	18818	Dumbledore	146	" I give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you . However , I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight . "
18852	18858	18788	18788	he	146	" Why not , sir ? "
18859	18865	18867	18867	Dumbledore	146	" You are with me , "
18870	18877	18867	18867	Dumbledore	146	" This will do , Harry . "
18891	18904	18905	18905	he	146	" You have not , of course , passed your Apparition Test , "
18908	18911	18913	18913	Harry	136	" No , "
18915	18924	18913	18913	Harry	136	" I thought you had to be seventeen ? "
18925	18929	18931	18931	Dumbledore	146	" You do , "
18933	18972	18973	18973	Harry	136	" So you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly . My left , if you do n't mind — as you have noticed , my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment . "
18980	18984	18986	18986	Dumbledore	146	" Very good , "
18988	18995	18986	18986	Dumbledore	146	" Well , here we go . "
19165	19171	19173	19173	Dumbledore	146	" Are you all right ? "
19181	19191	19173	19173	Dumbledore	146	" The sensation does take some getting used to . "
19192	19197	19199	19199	Harry	136	" I 'm fine , "
19217	19229	19199	19199	Harry	136	" But I think I might prefer brooms . . . . "
19248	19252	19230	19230	Dumbledore	146	" This way . "
19284	19291	19293	19293	Dumbledore	146	" So tell me , Harry , "
19295	19306	19293	19293	Dumbledore	146	" Your scar ... has it been hurting at all ? "
19324	19327	19328	19328	he	136	" No , "
19331	19357	19328	19328	he	136	" and I 've been wondering about that . I thought it would be burning all the time now Voldemort 's getting so powerful again . "
19373	19384	19386	19386	Dumbledore	146	" I , on the other hand , thought otherwise , "
19388	19418	19386	19386	Dumbledore	146	" Lord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying . It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you . "
19419	19427	19429	19429	Harry	136	" Well , I 'm not complaining , "
19469	19472	19462	19462	Harry	136	" Professor ? "
19473	19476	19386	19386	Dumbledore	146	" Harry ? "
19477	19485	19386	19386	Dumbledore	146	" Er — where exactly are we ? "
19486	19499	19462	19462	Harry	136	" This , Harry , is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton . "
19500	19508	19386	19386	Dumbledore	146	" And what are we doing here ? "
19509	19522	19524	19524	Dumbledore	146	" Ah yes , of course , I have n't told you , "
19526	19579	19524	19524	Dumbledore	146	" Well , I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years , but we are , once again , one member of staff short . We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts . "
19580	19590	19386	19386	Dumbledore	146	" How can I help with that , sir ? "
19592	19605	19607	19607	Dumbledore	146	" Oh , I think we 'll find a use for you , "
19610	19616	19607	19607	Dumbledore	146	" Left here , Harry . "
19671	19688	19655	19655	Harry	136	" Professor , why could n't we just Apparate directly into your old colleague 's house ? "
19689	19704	19706	19706	Dumbledore	146	" Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door , "
19708	19743	19706	19706	Dumbledore	146	" Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry . In any case , most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators . At Hogwarts , for instance — "
19744	19757	19759	19759	Harry	136	" — you ca n't Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds , "
19762	19768	19759	19759	Harry	136	" Hermione Granger told me . "
19769	19781	19706	19706	Dumbledore	146	" And she is quite right . We turn left again . "
19824	19842	19759	19759	Harry	136	" Sir , I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sacked . . . . "
19843	19846	19848	19848	Dumbledore	146	" Correct , "
19858	19886	19848	19848	Dumbledore	146	" He has been replaced , as I am sure you also saw , by Rufus Scrimgeour , who used to be Head of the Auror office . "
19887	19898	19900	19900	Harry	136	" Is he ... Do you think he 's good ? "
19902	19907	19909	19909	Dumbledore	146	" An interesting question , "
19911	19927	19909	19909	Dumbledore	146	" He is able , certainly . A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius . "
19928	19935	19848	19848	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , but I meant — "
19936	19970	19971	19971	Harry	136	" I know what you meant . Rufus is a man of action and , having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life , does not under - estimate Lord Voldemort . "
20009	20020	20005	20005	he	146	" And ... sir ... I saw about Madam Bones . "
20021	20024	20026	20026	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , "
20029	20049	20050	20050	He	146	" A terrible loss . She was a great witch . Just up here , I think — ouch . "
20058	20067	20050	20050	He	146	" Professor , what happened to your — ? "
20068	20077	20079	20079	Dumbledore	146	" I have no time to explain now , "
20081	20095	20096	20096	He	146	" It is a thrilling tale , I wish to do it justice . "
20120	20148	20112	20112	he	136	" Sir — I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl , about security measures we should all take against the Death Eaters . . . . "
20149	20157	20159	20159	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , I received one myself , "
20164	20171	20159	20159	Dumbledore	146	" Did you find it useful ? "
20172	20176	20112	20112	he	136	" Not really . "
20177	20214	20112	20112	he	136	" No , I thought not . You have not asked me , for instance , what is my favorite flavor of jam , to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor . "
20215	20222	20223	20223	Harry	136	" I did n't . . . "
20237	20276	20223	20223	Harry	136	" For future reference , Harry , it is raspberry . . . although of course , if I were a Death Eater , I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences before impersonating myself . "
20277	20284	20286	20286	Harry	136	" Er . . . right , "
20288	20313	20286	20286	Harry	136	" Well , on that leaflet , it said something about Inferi . What exactly are they ? The leaflet was n't very clear . "
20314	20319	20321	20321	Dumbledore	146	" They are corpses , "
20324	20388	20321	20321	Dumbledore	146	" Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard 's bidding . Inferi have not been seen for a long time , however , not since Voldemort was last powerful . . . . He killed enough people to make an army of them , of course . This is the place , Harry , just here . . . . "
20440	20451	20435	20435	Harry	136	" Oh dear . Oh dear , dear , dear . "
20490	20499	20500	20500	he	146	" Wand out and follow me , Harry , "
20539	20542	20543	20543	Dumbledore	146	" Lumos . "
20704	20711	20712	20712	he	146	" Not pretty , is it ? "
20716	20725	20712	20712	he	146	" Yes , something horrible has happened here . "
20778	20794	20795	20795	Harry	136	" Maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him off , Professor ? "
20821	20828	20830	20830	Dumbledore	146	" I do n't think so , "
20843	20850	20830	20830	Dumbledore	146	" You mean he 's — ? "
20851	20858	20863	20863	Dumbledore	146	" Still here somewhere ? Yes . "
20883	20886	20870	20870	his	146	" Ouch ! "
20887	20893	20895	20895	Dumbledore	146	" Good evening , Horace , "
20946	20959	20960	20960	he	1084	" There was no need to stick the wand in that hard , "
20969	20973	20960	20960	he	1084	" It hurt . "
21026	21032	21033	21033	he	1084	" What gave it away ? "
21066	21071	21073	21073	Dumbledore	146	" My dear Horace , "
21078	21100	21073	21073	Dumbledore	146	" if the Death Eaters really had come to call , the Dark Mark would have been set over the house . "
21112	21117	21118	21118	he	1086	" The Dark Mark , "
21121	21154	21118	21118	he	1086	" Knew there was something ... ah well . Would n't have had time anyway , I 'd only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room . "
21169	21178	21180	21180	Dumbledore	146	" Would you like my assistance clearing up ? "
21183	21186	21188	21189	the other	844	" Please , "
21297	21307	21309	21309	Dumbledore	146	" What kind of blood was that , incidentally ? "
21321	21328	21330	21331	the wizard	1086	" On the walls ? Dragon , "
21365	21370	21372	21373	the wizard	1086	" Yes , dragon , "
21376	21398	21399	21399	He	1086	" My last bottle , and prices are sky - high at the moment . Still , it might be reusable . "
21427	21433	21434	21434	He	1086	" Hmm . Bit dusty . "
21455	21458	21459	21459	he	1086	" Oho , "
21480	21483	21459	21459	he	1086	" Oho ! "
21484	21487	21489	21489	Dumbledore	146	" This , "
21498	21518	21489	21489	Dumbledore	146	" is Harry Potter . Harry , this is an old Friend and colleague of mine , Horace Slughorn . "
21528	21552	21553	21553	He	1086	" So that 's how you thought you 'd persuade me , is it ? Well , the answer 's no , Albus . "
21574	21586	21588	21588	Dumbledore	146	" I suppose we can have a drink , at least ? "
21590	21597	21598	21598	Slughorn	193	" For old time 's sake ? "
21601	21609	21610	21610	he	193	" All right then , one drink , "
21701	21704	21705	21705	he	193	" Hmpf , "
21719	21722	21723	21723	He	193	" Here — "
21770	21781	21782	21782	Dumbledore	146	" Well , how have you been keeping , Horace ? "
21785	21790	21792	21792	Slughorn	193	" Not so well , "
21796	21826	21792	21792	Slughorn	193	" Weak chest . Wheezy . Rheumatism too . Ca n't move like I used to . Well , that 's to be expected . Old age . Fatigue . "
21827	21848	21850	21850	Dumbledore	146	" And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice , "
21852	21865	21866	21866	Slughorn	193	" You ca n't have had more than three minutes ' warning ? "
21875	21895	21896	21896	he	193	" Two . Did n't hear my Intruder Charm go off , I was taking a bath . Still , "
21908	21940	21896	21896	he	193	" the fact remains that I 'm an old man , Albus . A tired old man who 's earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts . "
22007	22020	22022	22022	Dumbledore	146	" You 're not yet as old as I am , Horace , "
22024	22036	22038	22038	Slughorn	193	" Well , maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself , "
22052	22062	22041	22041	His	193	" Reactions not what they were , I see . "
22063	22069	22071	22071	Dumbledore	146	" You 're quite right , "
22103	22120	22121	22121	He	146	" 1 am undoubtedly slower than I was . But on the other hand . . . "
22209	22232	22234	22234	Dumbledore	146	" So , all these precautions against intruders , Horace ... are they for the Death Eaters ' benefit , or mine ? "
22236	22254	22256	22256	Slughorn	193	" What would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken - down old buffer like me ? "
22258	22279	22281	22281	Dumbledore	146	" I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion , torture , and murder , "
22283	22297	22281	22281	Dumbledore	146	" Are you really telling me that they have n't come recruiting yet ? "
22309	22411	22298	22298	Slughorn	193	" I have n't given them the chance . I 've been on the move for a year . Never stay in one place more than a week . Move from Muggle house to Muggle house — the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands — it 's been very pleasant , I 'll be sorry to leave . It 's quite easy once you know how , one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneako - scopes and make sure the neighbors do n't spot you bringing in the piano . "
22412	22415	22417	22417	Dumbledore	146	" Ingenious , "
22419	22451	22417	22417	Dumbledore	146	" But it sounds a rather tiring existence for a broken - down old buffer in search of a quiet life . Now , if you were to return to Hogwarts — "
22452	22508	22298	22298	Slughorn	193	" If you 're going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school , you can save your breath , Albus ! I might have been in hiding , but some funny rumors have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left ! If that 's how you treat teachers these days — "
22509	22519	22521	22521	Dumbledore	146	" Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd , "
22523	22554	22521	22521	Dumbledore	146	" I think you , Horace , would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs ' filthy half - breeds . ' "
22555	22565	22567	22567	Slughorn	193	" That 's what she did , did she ? "
22569	22577	22578	22578	Harry	136	" Idiotic woman . Never liked her . "
22590	22593	22594	22594	Harry	136	" Sorry , "
22598	22610	22594	22594	Harry	136	" It 's just — I did n't like her either . "
22617	22622	22624	22624	Slughorn	193	" Are you leaving ? "
22631	22644	22646	22646	Dumbledore	146	" No , I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom , "
22648	22651	22653	22653	Slughorn	193	" Oh , "
22658	22667	22668	22668	Dumbledore	146	" Second on the left down the hall . "
22730	22744	22745	22745	he	193	" Do n't think I do n't know why he 's brought you , "
22775	22783	22755	22755	Slughorn	193	" You look very like your father . "
22784	22792	22794	22794	Harry	136	" Yeah , I 've been told , "
22796	22807	22794	22794	Harry	136	" Except for your eyes . You 've got — - "
22808	22816	22817	22817	Harry	136	" My mother 's eyes , yeah . "
22830	22859	22860	22860	Slughorn	193	" Hmpf . Yes , well . You should n't have favorites as a teacher , of course , but she was one of mine . Your mother , "
22871	22915	22860	22860	Slughorn	193	" Lily Evans . One of the brightest I ever taught . Vivacious , you know . Charming girl . I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House . Very cheeky answers I used to get back too . "
22917	22923	22933	22933	Slughorn	193	" Which was your House ? "
22924	22931	22933	22933	Slughorn	193	" I was Head of Slytherin , "
22935	22940	22941	22941	he	193	" Oh , now , "
22961	23021	22941	22941	he	193	" do n't go holding that against me ! You 'll be Gryffindor like her , I suppose ? Yes , it usually goes in families . Not always , though . Ever heard of Sirius Black ? You must have done — been in the papers for the last couple of years — died a few weeks ago — "
23039	23101	23102	23102	He	136	" Well , anyway , he was a big pal of your father 's at school . The whole Black family had been in my House , but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor ! Shame — he was a talented boy . I got his brother , Regulus , when he came along , but I 'd have liked the set . "
23141	23175	23120	23120	he	136	" Your mother was Muggle - born , of course . Could n't believe it when I found out . Thought she must have been pure - blood , she was so good . "
23176	23187	23189	23189	Harry	136	" One of my best friends is Muggle - born , "
23191	23201	23189	23189	Harry	136	" and she 's the best in our year . "
23202	23213	23215	23215	Slughorn	193	" Funny how that sometimes happens , is n't it ? "
23217	23221	23223	23223	Harry	136	" Not really , "
23234	23243	23244	23244	he	193	" You must n't think I 'm prejudiced ! "
23247	23319	23244	23244	he	193	" No , no , no ! Have n't I just said your mother was one of my all - time favorite students ? And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year after her too — now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office , of course — another Muggle - born , a very gifted student , and still gives me excellent inside information on the goings - on at Gringotts ! "
23355	23480	23320	23320	He	136	" All ex - students , all signed . You 'll notice Barnabas Cuffe , editor of the Daily Prophet , he 's always interested to hear my take on the day 's news . And Ambrosius Flume , of Honeydukes — a hamper every birthday , and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkisss who gave him his first job ! And at the back — you 'll see her if you just crane your neck — that 's Gwenog Jones , who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies . . . . People are always astonished to hear I 'm on first - name terms with the Harpies , and free tickets whenever I want them ! "
23490	23506	23508	23508	Harry	136	" And all these people know where to find you , to send you stuff ? "
23560	23565	23566	23566	he	193	" Of course not , "
23574	23587	23566	23566	he	193	" I have been out of touch with everybody for a year . "
23611	23689	23608	23608	he	193	" Still . . . the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times . All very well for Dumbledore to talk , but taking up a post at Hog - warts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix ! And while I 'm sure they 're very admirable and brave and all the rest of it , I do n't personally fancy the mortality rate — - "
23690	23704	23706	23706	Harry	136	" You do n't have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts , "
23746	23786	23735	23735	Sirius	144	" Most of the teachers are n't in it , and none of them has ever been killed — well , unless you count Quirrell , and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort . "
23829	23860	23861	23861	Harry	136	" I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledore 's headmaster ; he 's supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever feared , is n't he ? "
23885	23913	23914	23914	he	193	" Well , yes , it is true that He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named has never sought a fight with Dumbledore , "
23918	24003	23914	23914	he	193	" And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Kilters , He - Who - Must - Not - Be - Named can hardly count me a friend . . . in which case , I might well be safer a little closer to Albus . . . . I can not pretend that Amelia Bones 's death did not shake me . . . . If she , with all her Ministry contacts and protection . . . "
24022	24031	24032	24032	he	193	" Oh , there you are , Albus , "
24035	24047	24032	24032	he	193	" You 've been a very long lime . Upset stomach ? "
24048	24059	24061	24061	Dumbledore	146	" No , I was merely reading the Muggle magazines , "
24063	24095	24061	24061	Dumbledore	146	" I do love knitting patterns . Well , Harry , we have trespassed upon Horace 's hospitality quite long enough ; I think it is time for us to leave . "
24114	24119	24109	24109	Slughorn	193	" You 're leaving ? "
24120	24137	24145	24145	Slughorn	193	" Yes , indeed . I think I know a lost cause when I see one . "
24138	24144	24145	24145	Slughorn	193	" Lost . . . ? "
24172	24187	24189	24189	Dumbledore	146	" Well , I 'm sorry you do n't want the job , Horace , "
24200	24231	24189	24189	Dumbledore	146	" Hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again . Our greatly increased security notwithstanding , you will always be welcome to visit , should you wish to . "
24232	24248	24296	24296	Slughorn	193	" Yes . . . well . . . very gracious ... as I say ... "
24249	24256	24262	24262	Harry	136	" Good - bye , then . "
24257	24260	24262	24262	Harry	136	" Bye , "
24279	24291	24292	24292	Dumbledore	146	" All right , all right , I 'll do it ! "
24307	24315	24296	24296	Slughorn	193	" You will come out of retirement ? "
24316	24321	24323	24323	Slughorn	193	" Yes , yes , "
24326	24335	24323	24323	Slughorn	193	" I must be mad , but yes . "
24336	24339	24341	24341	Dumbledore	146	" Wonderful , "
24345	24360	24341	24341	Dumbledore	146	" Then , Horace , we shall see you on the first of September . "
24361	24369	24371	24371	Slughorn	193	" Yes , I daresay you will , "
24389	24399	24382	24382	Slughorn	193	" I 'll want a pay rise , Dumbledore ! "
24427	24433	24435	24435	Dumbledore	146	" Well done , Harry , "
24437	24444	24446	24446	Harry	136	" I did n't do anything , "
24450	24476	24446	24446	Harry	136	" Oh yes you did . You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts . Did you like him ? "
24477	24480	24481	24481	Harry	136	" Er ... "
24531	24534	24536	24536	Dumbledore	146	" Horace , "
24549	24709	24536	24536	Dumbledore	146	" likes his comfort . He also likes the company of the famous , the successful , and the powerful . He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people . He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself ; he prefers the backseat — more room to spread out , you see . He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts , some - limcs for their ambition or their brains , sometimes for their charm or their talent , and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields . Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center , making introductions , forging useful contacts between members , and always reaping some kind of benefit in return , whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin liaison Office . "
24747	24754	24755	24755	Dumbledore	146	" I tell you all this , "
24758	24827	24755	24755	Dumbledore	146	" not to turn you against Horace — or , as we must now call him , Professor Slughorn — but to put you on your guard . He will undoubtedly try to collect you , Harry . You would be the jewel of his collection ; ' the Boy Who Lived ' ... or , as they call you these days , ' the Chosen One . ' "
24895	24909	24881	24881	Dumbledore	146	" This will do , Harry . If you will grasp my arm . "
25020	25029	25031	25031	Dumbledore	146	" If you do n't mind , Harry , "
25040	25060	25031	25031	Dumbledore	146	" I 'd like a few words with you before we part . In private . Perhaps in here ? "
25121	25173	25104	25104	his	146	" I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it , Harry , but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry . Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you . "
25206	25212	25203	25204	Uncle Vernon	179	" His godfather 's dead ? "
25227	25232	25234	25234	Dumbledore	146	" It was cruel , "
25237	25263	25234	25234	Dumbledore	146	" that you and Sirius had such a short time together . A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship . "
25339	25345	25346	25346	Harry	136	" It 's just hard , "
25355	25366	25346	25346	Harry	136	" to realize he wo n't write to me again . "
25434	25447	25449	25449	Dumbledore	146	" Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before , "
25452	25463	25449	25449	Dumbledore	146	" Naturally , the loss is devastating . . . . "
25473	25482	25483	25483	I	0	" interrupted Harry , his voice growing stronger , "
25544	25562	25563	25563	I	0	" he said fiercely , now looking straight into Dumbledore 's blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight , "
25588	25589	25596	25596	father	1133	" "
25605	25618	25619	25619	I	0	" said Dumbledore , with an approving pat on Harry 's back . "
25642	25670	25619	25619	I	0	" And now , Harry , on a closely related subject ... I gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks ? "
25671	25674	25676	25676	Harry	136	" Yes , "
25686	25711	25676	25676	Harry	136	" Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy ? "
25712	25715	25717	25717	Harry	136	" Yes , "
25720	25731	25717	25717	Harry	136	" And now everyone knows that I 'm the one — "
25738	25742	25734	25734	they	1136	" interrupted Dumbledore . "
25811	25835	25882	25882	he	146	" Now , I think I am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said ? "
25836	25839	25841	25841	Harry	136	" No , "
25843	25852	25854	25854	Dumbledore	146	" A wise decision , on the whole , "
25856	25881	25882	25882	he	146	" Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends , Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger . Yes , "
25890	25912	25882	25882	he	146	" I think they ought to know . You do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them . "
25913	25919	25930	25930	Dumbledore	146	" I did n't want — "
25920	25928	25930	25930	Dumbledore	146	" — to worry or frighten them ? "
25944	25982	25983	25983	Harry	136	" Or perhaps , to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened ? You need your friends , Harry . As you so rightly said , Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away . "
26000	26024	25997	25997	He	146	" On a different , though related , subject , it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year . "
26025	26031	26033	26033	Harry	136	" Private — with you ? "
26042	26060	26033	26033	Harry	136	" Yes . I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your education . "
26070	26071	26063	26063	you	146	" "
26084	26111	26063	26063	you	146	" said Dumbledore airily . Harry waited hopefully , but Dumbledore did not elaborate , so ho asked something else that had been bothering him slightly . "
26134	26148	26132	26132	I	0	" '' Professor Snape , Harry — and no , you will not . "
26149	26152	26154	26154	Harry	136	" Good , "
26158	26164	26154	26154	Harry	136	" because they were a — "
26177	26192	26194	26194	Dumbledore	146	" I think the word ' fiasco ' would be a good one here , "
26201	26218	26219	26219	he	136	" Well , that means I wo n't see much of Professor Snape from now on , "
26222	26250	26219	26219	he	136	" because he wo n't let me carry on Potions unless I get ' Outstanding ' in my OWL . , which I know I have n't . "
26251	26262	26264	26264	Dumbledore	146	" Do n't count your owls before they are delivered , "
26267	26296	26264	26264	Dumbledore	146	" Which , now I think of it , ought to be some time later today . Now , two more things , Harry , before we part . "
26330	26334	26328	26328	me	0	" Harry nodded . "
26423	26424	26425	26425	I	0	" "
26428	26433	26425	26425	I	0	" said Harry quickly . "
26439	26456	26457	26457	I	0	" said Dumbledore , pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard . "
26482	26482	26469	26469	Molly	223	"
26545	26550	26558	26559	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Who 's there ? "
26562	26566	26558	26559	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Declare yourself ! "
26567	26577	26633	26633	Dumbledore	146	" It is I , Dumbledore , bringing Harry . "
26601	26625	26586	26587	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Harry , dear ! Gracious , Albus , you gave me a fright , you said not to expect you before morning ! "
26626	26631	26633	26633	Dumbledore	146	" We were lucky , "
26641	26665	26633	26633	Dumbledore	146	" Slughorn proved much more persuadable than I had expected . Harry 's doing , of course . Ah , hello , Nymphadora ! "
26713	26718	26719	26719	she	1151	" Hello , Professor , "
26722	26727	26719	26719	she	1151	" Wotcher , Harry . "
26728	26733	26736	26736	she	1151	" Hi , Tonks . "
26772	26779	26780	26780	she	1151	" I 'd better be off , "
26794	26803	26780	26780	she	1151	" Thanks for the tea and sympathy , Molly "
26804	26813	26815	26815	Dumbledore	146	" Please do n't leave on my account , "
26818	26834	26815	26815	Dumbledore	146	" I can not stay , I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour . "
26835	26846	26848	26848	Tonks	226	" No , no , I need to get going , "
26856	26862	26848	26848	Tonks	226	" ' Night ? quot ; "
26883	26884	26889	26889	Molly	223	" "
26941	26953	26955	26955	Dumbledore	146	" Well , I shall see you at Hogwarts , Harry , "
26957	26968	26969	26969	He	136	" Take care of yourself . Molly , your servant . "
27018	27024	27025	27025	she	218	" You 're like Ron , "
27034	27071	27025	27025	she	218	" Both of you look as though you 've had Stretching jinxes put on you . -=-I Nwcar Ron 's grown four inches since I last bought him school robes . Are you hungry , Harry ? "
27072	27078	27080	27080	Harry	136	" Yeah , I am , "
27090	27102	27080	27080	Harry	136	" Sit down , dear , I 'll knock something up . "
27126	27132	27133	27133	he	136	" So Hermione 's here ? "
27144	27155	27157	27158	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Oh yes , she arrived the day before yesterday , "
27185	27250	27166	27166	her	218	" Everyone 's in bed , of course , we did n't expect you for hours . Here you are ? quot ; She tapped the pot again ; it rose into the air , flew toward Harry , and tipped over ; Mrs. Weasley slid a bowl nearly beneath it just in lime to catch the stream of thick , steaming onion soup . "
27255	27256	27253	27253	dear	4656	" "
27262	27306	27259	27260	Mrs. Weasley	218	" She waved her wand over her shoulder ; a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table ; as the loaf sliced itself and -=-llie soup pot dropped back onto the stove , Mrs. Weasley sat down opposite him . "
27317	27334	27335	27335	He	193	" Harry nodded , his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak . "
27341	27346	27335	27335	He	193	" said Mrs. Weasley . "
27372	27391	27368	27368	you	4656	" His mouth now full of bread , Harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head . "
27398	27406	27368	27368	you	4656	" said Mrs. Weasley , nodding wisely . "
27506	27541	27501	27501	Arthur	223	" It could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had been bursting to say this . Harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering . "
27546	27550	27501	27501	Arthur	223	" he gasped . "
27555	27571	27551	27551	You	4656	" beamed Mrs. Weasley , possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news . "
27624	27625	27617	27621	ten people reporting to him	1158	" "
27630	27631	27617	27621	ten people reporting to him	1158	" "
27819	27846	27795	27795	I	0	" Mrs. Weasley ended her speech with a stern look , as if it had been Harry suggesting that it was natural to miss spark plugs . "
27854	27858	27861	27861	he	220	" Harry asked . "
27890	27984	27878	27878	He	220	" She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table . Harry recognized it at once : It had nine hands , each inscribed with the name of a family member , and usually hung on i he Weasleys ' sitting room wall , though its current position suggested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her . Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at "
27988	27989	27878	27878	He	220	" "
28000	28013	27878	27878	He	220	" said Mrs. Weasley , in an un - convincingly casual voice , "
28073	28093	28066	28066	I	0	" With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock 's face . Mr. Weasley 's hand had switched to "
28096	28097	28098	28098	He	1169	" "
28102	28145	28146	28146	Arthur	223	" And sure enough , a moment later there was a knock on the back door . Mrs. Weasley jumped up and hurried to it ; with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly , "
28152	28153	28150	28150	you	223	" "
28156	28164	28150	28150	you	223	" came Mr. Weasley 's weary voice . "
28184	28185	28150	28150	you	223	" "
28190	28191	28192	28192	Molly	223	" "

28220	28250	28251	28251	Molly	223	" Mrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob , but apparently Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it on the other side , because the door remained firmly shut . "
28263	28264	28253	28253	I	0	" "
28275	28276	28265	28265	Arthur	223	" "
28291	28339	28279	28279	you	223	" Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs. Weasley had turned bright red ; he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck , and hastily gulped soup , clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl . -=-"Mollywobbles
28341	28357	28279	28279	you	223	" whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the crack at the edge of the door . "
28360	28365	28279	28279	you	223	" said Mr. Weasley . "
28373	28406	28367	28367	you	223	" Mrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband , a thin , balding , red - haired wizard wearing horn - rimmed spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak . "
28425	28445	28413	28413	we	1172	" said Mrs. Weasley , still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak . "
28464	28465	28449	28451	a Death Eater	4651	" "
28492	28504	28505	28505	Harry	136	" Mr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table . "
28515	28543	28507	28507	We	1172	" They shook hands , and Mr. Weasley dropped into the chair beside Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too . "

28680	28685	28686	28687	The boys	1179	" said Mr. Weasley . "

28767	28776	28777	28777	I	0	" said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once . "

28880	28902	28877	28878	Mr. Weasley	220	" said Harry , pushing back his chair . Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room . "
28907	28937	28905	28905	Harry	136	" said Mr. Weasley . Harry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen . All the hands were once again at "
28941	29221	28905	28905	Harry	136	" Fred and George 's bedroom was on the second floor . Mrs. Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once , bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow . Though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window , their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what Harry thought was gunpowder . A considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked , sealed cardboard boxes , amongst which stood Harry 's school trunk . The room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse . Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe , then took off through the window ; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting . Harry bade Mrs. Weasley good night , put on pajamas , and got into one of the beds . There was something hard inside the pillowcase . He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purple - and - orange sweet , which he recognized as a Puking Pastille . Smiling to himself , he rolled over and was instantly asleep . Seconds later , or so it seemed to Harry , he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open . Sitting bolt upright , he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back : The dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes . Shielding them with one hand , he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other . "
29224	29225	28905	28905	Harry	136	" "
29235	29256	29257	29257	Ron	229	" said a loud and excited voice , and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head . "
29264	29325	29262	29262	him	1190	" said a girl 's voice reproachfully . Harry 's hand found his glasses and he shoved them on , though I he light was so bright he could hardly see anyway . A long , looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment ; he blinked and Ron Weasley came into focus , grinning down at him . "
29329	29330	29262	29262	him	1190	" "
29335	29352	29353	29353	You	1190	" said Harry , rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows . "
29355	29356	29353	29353	You	1190	" "
29360	29374	29353	29353	You	1190	" said Ron , pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it . "
29388	29389	29381	29381	Mum	235	" "
29396	29397	29381	29381	Mum	235	" "
29410	29411	29405	29405	they	143	" "
29416	29431	29405	29405	they	143	" said Harry , as Hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed , "
29454	29455	29450	29450	you	1190	" "
29462	29510	29458	29458	I	0	" said Hermione , who was scrutinizing Harry as though he was sickening for something . He thought he knew what was behind this , and as he had no wish to discuss Sirius 's death or any other miserable subject at the moment , he said , "
29521	29522	29537	29537	she	235	" "
29543	29551	29537	29537	she	235	" said Ron , rolling his eyes . "
29560	29561	29537	29537	she	235	" "
29581	29582	29579	29579	I	0	" "
29587	29591	29579	29579	I	0	" said Ron . "
29599	29600	29607	29607	He	146	" "
29630	29631	29627	29628	Horace Slughorn	193	" "
29634	29641	29642	29642	We	1197	" said Ron , looking disappointed . "
29663	29674	29656	29656	Ron	217	" — we thought it 'd be something like that . "
29675	29679	29681	29681	Harry	136	" You did ? "
29685	29722	29681	29681	Harry	136	" Yeah . . . yeah , now Umbridge has left , obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , do n't we ? So , er , what 's he like ? "
29723	29741	29743	29743	Harry	136	" He looks a bit like a walrus , and he used to be Head of Slytherin , "
29745	29751	29743	29743	Harry	136	" Something wrong , Hermione ? "
29778	29800	29768	29768	She	194	" No , of course not ! So , um , did Slughorn seem like he 'll be a good teacher ? "
29801	29804	29806	29806	Harry	136	" Dunno , "
29808	29820	29806	29806	Harry	136	" He ca n't be worse than Umbridge , can he ? "
29821	29831	29768	29768	She	194	" I know someone who 's worse than Umbridge , "
29851	29856	29839	29839	Ron	217	" Hi , Harry . "
29857	29864	29865	29865	Ron	217	" What 's up with you ? "
29868	29873	29875	29875	Ginny	236	" It 's her , "
29885	29892	29878	29878	herself	236	" She 's driving me mad . "
29893	29900	29902	29902	Hermione	194	" What 's she done now ? "
29905	29923	29902	29902	Hermione	194	" It 's the way she talks to me ? you 'd think I was about three ! "
29924	29928	29933	29933	her	194	" I know , "
29936	29944	29933	29933	her	194	" She 's so full of herself . "
29966	29978	29961	29961	Ron	217	" Ca n't you two lay off her for five seconds ? "
29979	29989	29991	29991	Ginny	236	" Oh , that 's right , defend her , "
29993	30005	29991	29991	Ginny	236	" We all know you ca n't get enough of her . "
30030	30036	30027	30027	Harry	136	" Who are you ? ? "
30139	30143	30144	30144	she	1201	" ' Arry , "
30151	30159	30144	30144	she	1201	" Eet ' as been too long ! "
30184	30204	30169	30170	Mrs. Weasley	218	" There was no need to bring up the tray , I was just about to do it myself ! "
30205	30211	30213	30214	Fleur Delacour	238	" Eet was no trouble , "
30245	30280	30233	30233	He	136	" I ' ave been longing to see -=-'itn . You remember my seester , Gabrielle ? She never stops talking about ' Arry Potter . She will be delighted to see you again . "
30281	30289	30290	30290	Harry	136	" Oh ... is she here too ? "
30293	30301	30303	30303	Fleur	238	" No , no , silly boy , "
30309	30324	30303	30303	Fleur	238	" I mean next summer , when we ? but do you not know ? "
30341	30352	30331	30331	she	238	" We had n't got around to telling him yet . "
30375	30385	30360	30360	her	238	" Bill and I are going to be married ! "
30386	30389	30391	30391	Harry	136	" Oh , "
30416	30423	30424	30424	She	238	" Wow . Er ? congratulations ! "
30434	30517	30424	30424	She	238	" Bill is very busy at ze moment , working very ' ard , and I only work part - time at Gringotts for my Eenglish , so he brought me ' ere for a few days to get to know ' is family properly . I was so pleased to ' ear you would be coming ? zere is n't much to do ' ere , unless you like cooking and chickens ! Well ? enjoy your breakfast , ' Arry ! "
30548	30550	30540	30541	Mrs. Weasley	218	-=-"tchah ! "
30551	30556	30558	30558	Ginny	236	" Mum hates her , "
30561	30568	30570	30571	Mrs. Weasley	218	" I do not hate her ! "
30577	30592	30570	30571	Mrs. Weasley	218	" I just think they 've hurried into this engagement , that 's all ! "
30593	30602	30604	30604	Ron	217	" They 've known each other a year , "
30618	30694	30604	30604	Ron	217	" Well , that 's not very long ! I know why it 's happened , of course . Its all this uncertainty with You - Know - Who coming back , people think they might be dead tomorrow , so they 're rushing all sorts of decisions they 'd normally take time over . It was the same last time he was powerful , people eloping left , right , and center ? quot ; "
30700	30705	30696	30696	you	218	" said Ginny slyly . "
30727	30732	30733	30734	Whereas Bill	241	" said Mrs. Weasley . "
30772	30776	30778	30778	Ginny	236	" A cow , "
30782	30829	30778	30778	Ginny	236	" But Bill 's not that down - to - earth . He 's a Curse - Breaker , is n't he , he likes a bit of adventure , a bit of glamour . ... I expect that 's why he 's gone for Phlegm . "
30830	30838	30840	30841	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Stop calling her that , Ginny , "
30850	30870	30874	30874	she	1210	" Well , I 'd better get on . ... Eat your eggs while they 're warm , Harry . "
30904	30921	30922	30922	Harry	136	" Do n't you get used to her if she 's staying in the same house ? "
30925	30931	30933	30933	Ron	217	" Well , you do , "
30935	30948	30933	30933	Ron	217	" but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly , like then ... "
30949	30954	30956	30956	Hermione	194	" It 's pathetic , "
30985	30995	30996	30996	Ginny	236	" You do n't really want her around forever ? "
31009	31030	31006	31006	she	236	" Well , Mum 's going to put a stop to it if she can , I bet you anything . "
31031	31040	31042	31042	Harry	136	" How 's she going to manage that ? "
31044	31082	31042	31042	Harry	136	" She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner . I think she 's hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead . I hope he does , I 'd much rather have her in the family . "
31083	31090	31092	31092	Ron	217	" Yeah , that 'll work , "
31095	31140	31092	31092	Ron	217	" Listen , no bloke in his right mind 's going to fancy Tonks when Fleur 's around . I mean , Tonks is okay - looking when she is n't doing stupid things to her hair and her nose , but ? quot ; "
31153	31165	31167	31167	Hermione	194	" And she 's more intelligent , she 's an Auror ! "
31172	31188	31190	31190	Harry	136	" Fleur 's not stupid , she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament , "
31192	31198	31200	31200	Hermione	194	" Not you as well ! "
31203	31220	31222	31222	Ginny	236	" I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ' ' Any , ' do you ? "
31225	31228	31230	31230	Harry	136	" No , "
31238	31253	31233	31233	he	136	" I was just saying , Phlegm ? I mean , Fleur ? quot ; "
31264	31268	31254	31254	I	0	" said Ginny . "
31276	31277	31271	31271	she	226	" "
31288	31292	31278	31278	She	226	" said Ron . "
31307	31308	31299	31299	she	226	" "
31314	31318	31299	31299	she	226	" snapped Hermione . "
31341	31381	31336	31336	he	1214	" Harry 's heart sank . They had arrived at Sirius . He picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth , hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation . "
31390	31394	31395	31395	Sirius	144	" said Ron . "
31412	31419	31421	31421	Hermione	194	" That 's not the point , "
31423	31433	31421	31421	Hermione	194	" She thinks it was her limit he died ! "
31434	31443	31445	31445	Harry	136	" How does she work that one out ? "
31452	31485	31450	31450	himself	136	" Well , she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange , was n't she ? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off , Bellatrix could n't have killed Sirius . "
31486	31491	31493	31493	Ron	217	" That 's stupid , "
31495	31502	31504	31504	Hermione	194	" It 's survivor 's guilt , "
31506	31533	31504	31504	Hermione	194	" I know Lupin 's tried to talk her round , but she 's still really down . She 's actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing ! "
31534	31538	31450	31450	himself	136	" With her ? "
31539	31551	31553	31553	Hermione	194	" She ca n't change her appearance like she used to , "
31555	31570	31553	31553	Hermione	194	" I think her powers must have been affected by shock , or something . "
31571	31580	31582	31582	Harry	136	" I did n't know that could happen , "
31584	31589	31591	31591	Hermione	194	" Nor did I , "
31593	31603	31591	31591	Hermione	194	" but I suppose if you 're really depressed ... "
31616	31619	31620	31620	she	218	" Ginny , "
31623	31633	31620	31620	she	218	" come downstairs and help me with the lunch . "
31634	31642	31644	31644	Ginny	236	" I 'm talking to this lot ! "
31648	31651	31653	31654	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Now ! "
31659	31676	31678	31678	Ginny	236	" She only wants me there so she does n't have to be alone with Phlegm ! "
31709	31719	31720	31720	she	236	" You lot had better come down quickly too , "
31780	31785	31760	31760	Ron	217	" What 's this ? "
31799	31802	31804	31804	Ron	217	" Dunno , "
31806	31830	31804	31804	Ron	217	" but if Fred and -=-GeorgeVe left it here , it 's probably not ready for the joke shop yet , so be careful "
31831	31841	31843	31843	Harry	136	" Your mum said the shop 's going well , "
31845	31858	31843	31843	Harry	136	" Said Fred and George have got a real flair for business . "
31859	31865	31867	31867	Ron	217	" That 's an understatement , "
31869	31921	31867	31867	Ron	217	" They 're raking in the Galleons ! I ca n't wait to see the place , we have n't been to Diagon Alley yet , because Mum says Dad 's got to be there for extra security and he 's been really busy at work , but it sounds excellent . "
31922	31928	31930	31930	Harry	136	" And what about Percy ? "
31948	31959	31930	31930	Harry	136	" Is he talking to your mum and dad again ? "
31960	31963	31965	31965	Ron	217	" Nope , "
31967	31985	31965	31965	Ron	217	" But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back ? quot ; "
32003	32007	31986	31986	Dumbledore	146	" said Hermione . "
32017	32018	32015	32015	Ron	217	" "
32030	32034	32026	32026	Dumbledore	146	" said Ron . "
32047	32064	32035	32035	He	146	" said Harry conversationally . Ron choked on his bit of toast , and Hermione gasped . "
32070	32074	32065	32065	You	217	" said Ron . "
32080	32085	32086	32086	He	146	" said Harry honestly . "
32096	32097	32086	32086	He	146	" "
32107	32114	32105	32105	Dumbledore	146	" said Ron , looking impressed . "
32124	32196	32118	32118	he	146	" His voice tailed away . Harry saw him and Hermione exchange looks . Harry laid down his knife and fork , his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed . Dumbledore had said to do it . ... Why not now ? He fixed his eyes on his fork , which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap , and said , "
32223	32248	32249	32249	You	1228	" Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke . Harry had the impression that both had frozen . He continued , still speaking to his fork , "
32263	32264	32249	32249	You	1228	" "
32273	32278	32279	32279	It	1232	" said Hermione quickly . "
32283	32284	32293	32293	Ron	217	" "
32299	32302	32296	32296	Hermione	194	" Shh ! "
32303	32311	32313	32313	Harry	136	" The Prophet 's got it right , "
32332	32378	32379	32379	Harry	136	" That glass ball that smashed was n't the only record of the prophecy . I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore 's office , he was the one the prophecy was made to , so he could tell me . From what it said , "
32385	32417	32379	32379	Harry	136	" it looks like I 'm the one who 's got to finish off Voldemort . ... At least , it said neither of us could live while the other survives . "
32448	32451	32453	32453	Harry	136	" Hermione ! "
32489	32500	32501	32501	she	194	" I squeezed it and it ? it punched me ! "
32526	32531	32533	32533	Ron	217	" Do n't worry , "
32543	32558	32533	32533	Ron	217	" Mum'll fix that , she 's good at healing minor injuries ? quot ; "
32567	32572	32573	32573	Harry	136	" said Hermione hastily . "
32581	32593	32577	32577	Harry	136	" She sat down on the edge of his bed again . "
32657	32666	32653	32653	Harry	136	" She stared at him , then whispered , "
32671	32672	32677	32677	I	0	" "
32680	32684	32677	32677	I	0	" said Harry . "
32719	32720	32711	32711	him	192	" "
32749	32754	32733	32733	he	146	" said Ron eagerly . "
32796	32797	32787	32787	he	146	" "
32802	32806	32787	32787	he	146	" said Hermione . "
32837	32928	32810	32810	he	146	" Harry did not really listen . A warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight ; a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving . He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on , but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him , speaking bracing words of comfort , not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous , was worth more than he could ever tell them . "
32935	32939	32810	32810	he	146	" concluded Hermione . "
32973	32974	32964	32964	I	0	" "
32987	32991	32964	32964	I	0	" said Ron . "
32995	33012	33013	33013	I	0	" said Harry , as another part of last night 's conversation came back to him . "
33025	33026	33015	33015	Dumbledore	146	" "
33029	33033	33015	33015	Dumbledore	146	" shrieked Hermione . "
33059	33072	33053	33053	She	1239	" I 'm going to see whether any owls have come . ... "
33118	33125	33106	33107	Mrs. Weasley	218	" It just wo n't budge , "
33151	33159	33126	33127	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Bruises , Cuts , and Abrasions . "
33160	33174	33126	33127	Mrs. Weasley	218	" This has always worked before , I just ca n't understand it . "
33175	33197	33199	33199	Ginny	236	" It 'll be Fred and George 's idea of a funny joke , making sure it ca n't come off , "
33201	33210	33212	33212	Hermione	194	" But it 's got to come off ! "
33214	33225	33212	33212	Hermione	194	" I ca n't go around looking like this forever ! "
33226	33243	33245	33246	Mrs. Weasley	218	" You wo n't , dear , we 'll find an antidote , do n't worry , "
33249	33261	33263	33263	Fleur	238	" Bill told me W Fred and George are very amusing ! "
33268	33278	33280	33280	Hermione	194	" Yes , I can hardly breathe for laughing , "
33299	33316	33282	33282	She	194	" Mrs. Weasley , you 're quite , quite sure no owls have arrived this morning ? "
33317	33327	33329	33330	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Yes , dear , I 'd have noticed , "
33333	33350	33329	33330	Mrs. Weasley	218	" But it 's barely nine , there 's still plenty of time . . . . "
33351	33360	33362	33362	Hermione	194	" I know I messed up Ancient Runes , "
33365	33405	33362	33362	Hermione	194	" I definitely made at least one serious mistranslation . And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all . I thought Transfiguration went all right at the time , but looking back ? quot ; "
33423	33427	33406	33406	Hermione	194	" barked Ron . "
33440	33441	33406	33406	Hermione	194	" "
33451	33460	33461	33461	I	0	" said Hermione , flapping her hands hysterically . "
33468	33469	33406	33406	Hermione	194	" "
33476	33492	33493	33493	We	1243	" Harry asked the room at large , but it was again Hermione who answered . "
33514	33528	33503	33503	I	0	" Harry 's stomach squirmed . He wished he had eaten less breakfast . "
33532	33537	33503	33503	I	0	" said Fleur complacently , "
33605	33611	33613	33613	Ron	217	" They 're definitely owls , "
33625	33633	33635	33635	Harry	136	" And there are three of them , "
33643	33650	33652	33652	Hermione	194	" One for each of us , "
33658	33668	33669	33669	She	194	" Oh no ... oh no ... oh no ... "
33720	33724	33726	33726	Hermione	194	" Oh no ! "
34017	34019	34027	34027	He	136	" Outstanding "
34048	34063	34064	34064	he	217	" Only failed Divination and History of Magic , and who cares about them ? "
34070	34087	34064	34064	he	217	" Here ? swap ? quot ; Harry glanced down Ron 's grades : There were no "
34089	34095	34097	34097	you	136	" there . . . . "
34108	34118	34097	34097	you	136	" said Ron , punching Harry on the shoulder . "
34129	34130	34127	34127	we	1254	" "
34134	34145	34146	34147	Seven OWLs	1255	" said Mrs. Weasley proudly , ruffling Ron 's hair . "
34159	34160	34161	34161	Hermione	194	" "
34163	34176	34161	34161	Hermione	194	" said Ginny tentatively , for Hermione still had n't turned around . "
34182	34183	34179	34179	you	136	" "
34189	34197	34184	34184	I	0	" said Hermione in a small voice . "
34204	34221	34184	34184	I	0	" said Ron , striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand . "
34241	34256	34257	34257	You	136	" He looked down at her , half - amused , half - exasperated . "
34266	34276	34264	34264	you	136	" Hermione shook her head , but Harry laughed . "
34285	34289	34290	34290	Mum	235	" grinned Ron . "
34298	34500	34290	34290	Mum	235	" Harry looked back down at his results . They were as good as he could have hoped for . He felt just one tiny twinge of regret . . . . This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror . He had not secured the required Potions grade . He had known all along that he would n't , but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E. It was odd , really , seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror , but somehow the idea had taken hold of him , and he could n't really think of anything else he would like to be . Moreover , it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago . . . . Neither can live while the other survives . . . .Wouldn't he be living up to the prophecy , and giving himself the best chance of survival , if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Voldemort ?
34676	34686	34687	34687	he	136	" There have been another couple of dementor attacks , "
34702	34764	34691	34692	Mrs. Weasley	218	" And they 've found Igor Karkaroff 's body in a shack up north . The Dark Mark had been set over it — well , frankly , I 'm surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters ; Sirius 's brother , Regulus , only managed a few days as far as I can remember . "
34765	34770	34772	34773	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Yes , well , "
34777	34786	34772	34773	Mrs. Weasley	218	" perhaps we should talk about something diff — "
34787	34797	34799	34799	Bill	241	" Did you hear about Florean Fortescue , Remus ? "
34810	34816	34808	34808	Fleur	238	" The man who ran — "
34817	34828	34829	34829	Harry	136	" — the ice - cream place in Diagon Alley ? "
34845	34861	34829	34829	Harry	136	" He used to give me free ice creams . What 's happened to him ? "
34862	34873	34808	34808	Fleur	238	" Dragged off , by the look of his place . "
34874	34877	34879	34879	Ron	217	" Why ? "
34889	34908	34882	34883	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Who knows ? He must 've upset them somehow . He was a good man , Florean . "
34909	34915	34917	34918	Mr. Weasley	220	" Talking of Diagon Alley , "
34920	34928	34917	34918	Mr. Weasley	220	" looks like Ollivander 's gone too . "
34929	34933	34935	34935	Ginny	236	" The wandmaker ? "
34940	34967	34935	34935	Ginny	236	" That 's the one . Shop 's empty . No sign of a struggle . No one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped . "
34968	34979	34882	34883	Mrs. Weasley	218	" But wands — what 'll people do for wands ? "
34980	34989	34991	34991	Lupin	227	" They 'll make do with other makers , "
34993	35016	34991	34991	Lupin	227	" But Ollivander was the best , and if the other side have got him it 's not so good for us . "
35047	35056	35058	35058	Hermione	194	" That gives you equal status with prefects ! "
35061	35072	35058	35058	Hermione	194	" You can use our special bathroom now and everything ! "
35073	35085	35087	35087	Ron	217	" Wow , I remember when Charlie wore one of these , "
35095	35126	35087	35087	Ron	217	" Harry , this is so cool , you 're my Captain — if you let me back on the team , I suppose , ha ha . . . . "
35127	35151	35153	35154	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Well , I do n't suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you 've got these , "
35162	35190	35153	35154	Mrs. Weasley	218	" We 'll go on Saturday as long as your father does n't have to go into work again . I 'm not going there without him . "
35191	35215	35217	35217	Ron	217	" Mum , d'you honestly think You - Know - Who 's going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts ? "
35219	35230	35232	35233	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday , did they ? "
35240	35261	35232	35233	Mrs. Weasley	218	" If you think security 's a laughing matter you can stay behind and I 'll get your things myself — "
35262	35279	35281	35281	Ron	217	" No , I wanna come , I want to see Fred and George 's shop ! "
35284	35308	35310	35311	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Then you just buck up your ideas , young man , before I decide you 're too immature to come with us ! "
35328	35332	35310	35311	Mrs. Weasley	218	" mortal peril , "
35347	35358	35359	35359	Ron	217	" And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well ! "
35387	35406	35378	35378	her	218	" Blimey . . . you ca n't even make a joke round here anymore . . . . "
35472	35477	35479	35479	Ron	217	" Where 's mine ? "
35487	35496	35498	35498	Bill	241	" That 's already Harry 's , idiot , "
35500	35563	35498	35498	Bill	241	" I got it out of your vault for you , Harry , because it 's taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment , the goblins have tightened security so much . Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up his ... Well , trust me , this way 's easier . "
35564	35569	35571	35571	Harry	136	" Thanks , Bill , "
35578	35585	35587	35587	Fleur	238	" E is always so thoughtful , "
35662	35673	35675	35675	Ron	217	" It 's good Dad can get us these again , "
35718	35733	35738	35738	his	220	" Do n't get used to it , it 's only because of Harry , "
35769	35795	35796	35796	Harry	136	" He 's been given top - grade security status . And we 'll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too . "
35867	35874	35876	35877	the driver	1279	" Here you are , then , "
35904	35920	35876	35877	the driver	1279	" I 'm to wait for you , any idea how long you 'll be ? "
35921	35930	35932	35933	Mr. Weasley	220	" A couple of hours , I expect , "
35935	35944	35932	35933	Mr. Weasley	220	" Ah , good , he 's here ! "
36009	36012	36013	36013	he	190	" Harry ! "
36034	36061	36013	36013	he	190	" Buckbeak — Witherwings , I mean — yeh should see him , Harry , he 's so happy ter be back in the open air — "
36062	36068	36070	36070	Harry	136	" Glad he 's pleased , "
36079	36090	36074	36074	he	136	" We did n't know ' security ' meant you ! "
36091	36123	36125	36125	Hagrid	190	" I know , jus ' like old times , innit ? See , the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o ' Aurors , but Dumbledore said I 'd do , "
36140	36153	36125	36125	Hagrid	190	" Lets get goin' then — after yeh , Molly , Arthur — "
36204	36224	36200	36200	Hagrid	190	" Jus ' passin ' through today , Tom , sure yeh understand , Hogwarts business , yeh know . "
36493	36502	36503	36503	he	1299	" One for your little girl , madam ? "
36516	36522	36503	36503	he	1299	" Protect her pretty neck ? "
36523	36532	36534	36535	Mr. Weasley	220	" If I were on duty . . . "
36544	36563	36565	36566	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Yes , but do n't go arresting anyone now , dear , we 're in a hurry , "
36573	36625	36565	36566	Mrs. Weasley	218	" I think we 'd better do Madam Malkin 's first , Hermione wants new dress robes , and Ron 's showing much too much ankle in his school robes , and you must need new ones too , Harry , you 've grown so much — come on , everyone — "
36626	36645	36647	36648	Mr. Weasley	220	" Molly , it does n't make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin 's , "
36650	36676	36647	36648	Mr. Weasley	220	" Why do n't those three go with Hagrid , and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyone 's school - books ? "
36677	36683	36685	36686	Mrs. Weasley	218	" I do n't know , "
36709	36718	36647	36648	Mr. Weasley	220	" Hagrid , do you think — - ? "
36719	36733	36735	36735	Hagrid	218	" Don ' fret , they 'll be fine with me , Molly , "
36843	36859	36861	36861	Hagrid	218	" Migh ' be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us , "
36877	36887	36861	36861	Hagrid	218	" I 'll stand guard outside , all right ? "
36942	36969	36983	36984	Madam Malkin	263	" . . . not a child , in case you have n't noticed , Mother . I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone . "
36991	37026	36983	36984	Madam Malkin	263	" Now , dear , your mother 's quite right , none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore , it 's nothing to do with being a child — "
37027	37039	36983	36984	Madam Malkin	263	" Watch where you 're sticking that pin , will you ! "
37116	37134	37136	37137	Draco Malfoy	170	" If you 're wondering what the smell is , Mother , a Mudblood just walked in , "
37139	37153	37155	37156	Madam Malkin	263	" I do n't think there 's any need for language like that ! "
37173	37186	37187	37187	she	263	" And I do n't want wands drawn in my shop either ! "
37226	37240	37215	37215	Hermione	194	" No , do n't , honestly , it 's not worth it . "
37241	37254	37256	37256	Malfoy	170	" Yeah , like you 'd dare do magic out of school , "
37258	37273	37256	37256	Malfoy	170	" Who blacked your eye , Granger ? I want to send them flowers . "
37274	37280	37282	37283	Madam Malkin	263	" That 's quite enough ! "
37293	37298	37282	37283	Madam Malkin	263	" Madam — please — "
37309	37314	37315	37315	she	152	" Put those away , "
37323	37346	37315	37315	she	152	" If you at - tack my son again , I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do . "
37347	37350	37352	37352	Harry	136	" Really ? "
37387	37404	37378	37378	He	136	" Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in , are you ? "
37414	37432	37405	37406	Madam Malkin	263	" Really , you should n't accuse — dangerous thing to say — wands away , please ! "
37446	37477	37441	37442	Narcissa Malfoy	152	" I see that being Dumbledore 's favorite has given you a false sense of security , Harry Potter . But Dumbledore wo n't always be there to protect you . "
37486	37529	37478	37478	Harry	136	" Wow . . . look at that . . . he 's not here now ! So why not have a go ? They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband ! "
37549	37563	37564	37564	Malfoy	152	" Do n't you dare talk to my mother like that , Potter ! "
37567	37575	37577	37577	Narcissa	152	" It 's all right , Draco , "
37590	37607	37582	37582	her	152	" I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius . "
37615	37620	37611	37611	his	136	" Harry , no ! "
37637	37658	37611	37611	his	136	" Think . . . . You must n't . . . . You 'll be in such trouble . ... "
37700	37720	37688	37688	She	263	" I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more , dear , let me just — "
37721	37724	37726	37726	Malfoy	170	" Ouch ! "
37733	37755	37756	37756	He	170	" Watch where you 're putting your pins , woman ! Mother — I do n't think I want these anymore — "
37775	37782	37784	37784	Narcissa	152	" You 're right , Draco , "
37793	37818	37784	37784	Narcissa	152	" now I know the kind of scum that shops here . . . . We 'll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting 's . "
37850	37940	37841	37841	he	170	" Well , really ? said Madam Malkin , snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner , so that it removed all the dust . She was distracted all through the fitting of Ron 's and Harry 's new robes , tried to sell Hermione wizard 's dress robes instead of witch 's , and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them . "
37944	37955	37841	37841	he	170	" asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side . "
37959	37963	37841	37841	he	170	" said Harry . "
37970	37971	37965	37965	you	1318	" "
37974	37980	37981	37981	Bu	1319	" said Hagrid , unconcerned . "
38004	38040	38041	38041	Everyone	4750	" Harry , Ron , and Hermione exchanged looks , but before they could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable notion , Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny appeared , all clutching heavy packages of books . "
38045	38050	38052	38052	your	1322	" said Mrs. Weasley . "
38084	38158	38159	38159	We	1325	" Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothecary , seeing that they were no longer studying Potions , but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium . Then , with Mrs. Weasley checking her watch every minute or so , they headed farther along the street in search of Weasleys ' Wizard Wheezes , the joke shop run by Fred and George . "
38167	38172	38159	38159	We	1325	" Mrs. Weasley said . "
38209	38210	38189	38189	We	1325	" "
38211	38401	38189	38189	We	1325	Whoa,"said Ron , stopping in his tracks . Set against the dull , poster - muffled shop Fronts around them , Fred and Georges windows hit the eye like a firework display . Casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows , and a few rather stunned - looking people had actually come to a halt , transfixed . The left - hand window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved , popped , flashed , bounced , and shrieked ; Harrys eyes began to water just looking at it . The right - hand window was covered with a gigantic poster , purple like those of the Ministry , but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters : WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOU - KNOW - WHO ? YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT U - NO - POO-- THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THAT 'S GRIPPING THE NATION ! Harry started to laugh . He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing , dumbfounded , at the poster . Her lips moved silently , mouthing the name "
38408	38409	38189	38189	We	1325	" "
38418	38422	38189	38189	We	1325	" she whispered . "
38428	38440	38189	38189	We	1325	" said Ron , who , like Harry , was laughing . "
38445	38643	38189	38189	We	1325	" And he and Harry led the way into the shop . It was packed with customers ; Harry could not get near the shelves . He stared around , looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling : Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last , unfinished year at Hogwarts ; Harry noticed that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular , with only one battered box left on the shelf . There were bins full of trick wands , the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved , the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck , and boxes of quills , which came in Self - Inking , Spell - Checking , and Smart - Answer varieties . A space cleared in the crowd , and Harry pushed his way toward the counter , where a gaggle of delighted ten - year - olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows , both perched on a box that read : reusable hangman — spell it or he 'll swing ! "
38696	38751	38753	38753	Hermione	194	" ' One simple incantation and you will enter a top - quality , highly realistic , thirty - minute daydream , easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable ( side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling ) . Not for sale to under - sixteens . You know , "
38760	38767	38753	38753	Hermione	194	" that really is extraordinary magic ! "
38768	38774	38776	38779	a voice behind them	1332	" For that , Hermione , "
38781	38789	38776	38779	a voice behind them	1332	" you can have one for free . "
38811	38818	38790	38792	A beaming Fred	1334	" How are you , Harry ? "
38823	38834	38790	38792	A beaming Fred	1334	" And what 's happened to your eye , Hermione ? "
38835	38840	38841	38841	she	194	" Your punching telescope , "
38845	38854	38856	38856	Fred	232	" Oh blimey , I forgot about those , "
38858	38861	38862	38862	He	1334	" Here — "
38887	38901	38903	38903	Fred	232	" Just dab it on , that bruise'll be gone within the hour , "
38905	38925	38903	38903	Fred	232	" We had to find a decent bruise remover . We 're testing most of our products on ourselves . "
38930	38939	38940	38940	she	194	" It is safe , is n't it ? "
38944	38949	38951	38951	Fred	232	" Course it is , "
38954	38967	38968	38968	Harry	136	" Come on , Harry , I 'll give you a tour . "
38998	39003	39005	39005	Fred	232	" Muggle magic tricks ! "
39012	39055	39005	39005	Fred	232	" For freaks like Dad , you know , who love Muggle stuff . It 's not a big earner , but we do fairly steady business , they 're great novelties . . . . Oh , here 's George . ... "
39064	39101	39102	39102	he	269	" Giving him the tour ? Come through the back , Harry , that 's where we 're making the real money — pocket anything , you , and you 'll pay in more than Galleons ! "
39157	39167	39169	39169	Fred	232	" We 've just developed this more serious line , "
39171	39179	39169	39169	Fred	232	" Funny how it happened . . . "
39180	39205	39207	39207	George	233	" You would n't believe how many people , even people who work at the Ministry , ca n't do a decent Shield Charm , "
39209	39223	39207	39207	George	233	" ' Course , they did n't have you teaching them , Harry . "
39224	39288	39169	39169	Fred	232	" That 's right . . . . Well , we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh , you know , challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off . But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff ! And we 're still getting massive orders ! "
39289	39304	39169	39169	Fred	232	" So we 've expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks , Shield Gloves ... "
39305	39331	39207	39207	George	233	" ... I mean , they would n't help much against the Unforgivable Curses , but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes . . . "
39332	39359	39361	39361	George	233	" And then we thought we 'd get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts , because it 's such a money spinner , "
39364	39392	39361	39361	George	233	" This is cool . Look , Instant Darkness Powder , we 're importing it from Peru . Handy if you want to make a quick escape . "
39393	39407	39409	39409	Fred	232	" And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves , look , "
39434	39464	39409	39409	Fred	232	" You just drop one surreptitiously and it 'll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight , giving you a diversion if you need one . "
39467	39473	39409	39409	Fred	232	" said Harry , impressed . "
39476	39514	39409	39409	Fred	232	" said George , catching a couple and throwing them to Harry . A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain ; Harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes . "
39533	39548	39530	39531	Mr. Weasley	220	" she said . Harry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called "
39552	39561	39549	39550	Mr. Weasley	220	" but they took it in their stride . "
39572	39577	39578	39578	Harry	136	" said George promptly . "
39594	39595	39596	39596	I	0	" "
39602	39621	39596	39596	I	0	" said Harry , who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators . "
39628	39639	39622	39622	You	136	" said Fred firmly , waving away Harry 's gold . "
39642	39643	39644	39644	You	136	" "
39658	39662	39644	39644	You	136	" said George sternly "
39683	39721	39644	39644	You	136	" George swept off through the curtain to help with the customers , and Fred led Harry back into the main part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still poring over the Patented Daydream Charms . "
39733	39737	39724	39725	you girls	1345	" asked Fred . "
39746	39778	39741	39741	ladies	1346	" Near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically . Hermione and Ginny both hung back , looking wary . "
39783	39788	39780	39780	you	1344	" said Fred proudly . "
39799	39806	39741	39741	ladies	1346	" Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically . "
39811	39815	39817	39817	they	1347	" she asked . "
39840	39841	39835	39838	the boy in question	1348	" "
39850	39860	39847	39848	the girl	1349	" said George , reappearing suddenly at their side . "
39871	39879	39847	39848	the girl	1349	" he added , becoming suddenly stern , "
39897	39898	39882	39882	she	1350	" "
39911	39928	39904	39904	Ron	217	" said Ginny calmly , leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf . "
39933	39934	39935	39940	Guaranteed ten - second pimple vanisher	1352	" "
39942	39946	39935	39940	Guaranteed ten - second pimple vanisher	1352	" said Fred . "
39978	39979	39975	39976	Dean Thomas	261	" "
39985	39989	39975	39976	Dean Thomas	261	" said Ginny . "
40009	40043	39975	39976	Dean Thomas	261	" She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple , all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting high - pitched squeaks . "
40047	40051	39975	39976	Dean Thomas	261	" said George . "
40069	40070	40071	40071	I	0	" "
40081	40103	40075	40075	he	275	" said Ginny , putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it . "
40109	40110	40111	40111	They	1356	" "
40118	40122	40111	40111	They	1356	" conceded Fred . "
40137	40172	40186	40186	she	1358	" Ginny turned to look at him , her hands on her hips . There was such a Mrs. Weasley - ish glare on her face that Harry was surprised Fred did n't recoil . "
40205	40216	40186	40186	she	1358	" not to tell tales about me to these two ! "
40217	40230	40232	40232	Fred	232	" That 's three Galleons , nine Sickles , and a Knut , "
40243	40247	40232	40232	Fred	232	" Cough up . "
40248	40254	40186	40186	she	1358	" I 'm your brother ! "
40255	40278	40186	40186	she	1358	" And that 's our stuff you 're nicking . Three Galleons , nine Sickles . I 'll knock off the Knut . "
40279	40291	40232	40232	Fred	232	" But I have n't got three Galleons , nine Sickles ! "
40292	40311	40312	40312	Ron	217	" You 'd better put it back then , and mind you put it on the right shelves . "
40343	40358	40359	40359	she	218	" If I see you do that again I 'll jinx your fingers together , "
40363	40373	40375	40375	Ginny	236	" Mum , can I have a Pygmy Puff ? "
40379	40383	40385	40386	Mrs. Weasley	218	" A what ? "
40389	40400	40385	40386	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Look , they 're so sweet . . . . "
40470	40477	40479	40479	Harry	136	" Wonder where his mummy is ? "
40483	40494	40496	40496	Ron	217	" Given her the slip by the looks of it , "
40498	40503	40505	40505	Hermione	194	" Why , though ? "
40622	40629	40631	40631	Harry	136	" Get under here , quick , "
40642	40652	40654	40654	Hermione	194	" Oh — I do n't know , Harry , "
40662	40665	40667	40667	Ron	217	" Come on\ "
40741	40749	40751	40751	Harry	136	" He was going in that direction , "
40767	40770	40751	40751	Harry	136	“ Cmon . ”
40791	40800	40801	40801	she	194	" That 's him , is n't it ? "
40804	40808	40801	40801	she	194	" Turning left ? "
40809	40813	40815	40815	Ron	217	" Big surprise , "
40833	40842	40844	40844	Harry	136	" Quick , or we 'll lose him , "
40849	40855	40857	40857	Hermionc	279	" Our feet'Il be seen ! "
40885	40891	40893	40893	Harry	136	" It does n't matter , "
40896	40900	40893	40893	Harry	136	" Just hurry ! "
40977	40980	40992	40992	she	194	" Ouch ! "
40981	40991	40992	40992	she	194	" Shh ! Look ! He 's in there ! "
41120	41131	41133	41133	Hermione	194	" If only we could hear what they 're saying ! "
41135	41139	41141	41141	Ron	217	" We can ! "
41144	41150	41151	41151	He	217	" Hang on — damn — "
41170	41176	41151	41151	He	217	" Extendable Ears , look ! "
41177	41180	41182	41182	Hermione	194	" Fantastic ! "
41205	41216	41185	41185	Ron	217	" Oh , I hope the door is n't Imperturbable — "
41217	41220	41222	41222	Ron	217	" No ! "
41225	41228	41222	41222	Ron	217	" Listen ! "
41265	41276	41246	41246	Malfoy	170	" . . . you know how to fix it ? "
41277	41280	41282	41282	Borgin	280	" Possibly , "
41296	41316	41282	41282	Borgin	280	" I 'll need to see it , though . Why do n't you bring it into the shop ? "
41317	41322	41324	41324	Malfoy	170	" I ca n't , "
41326	41346	41324	41324	Malfoy	170	" It 's got to stay put . I just need you to tell me how to do it . "
41355	41382	41351	41351	his	280	" Well , without seeing it , I must say it will be a very difficult job , perhaps impossible . I could n't guarantee anything . "
41383	41386	41388	41388	Malfoy	170	" No ? "
41404	41413	41414	41414	He	280	" Perhaps this will make you more confident . "
41455	41459	41461	41461	Maifoy	282	" Tell anyone , "
41463	41502	41461	41461	Maifoy	282	" and there will be retribution . You know Fenrir Greyback ? He 's a family friend . He 'll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you 're giving the problem your full attention . "
41503	41511	41449	41449	Borgin	280	" There will be no need for — "
41512	41518	41520	41520	Malfoy	170	" I 'll decide that , "
41522	41546	41520	41520	Malfoy	170	" Well , I 'd better be off . And do n't forget to keep that one safe , I 'll need it . "
41547	41557	41449	41449	Borgin	280	" Perhaps you 'd like to take it now ? "
41558	41589	41449	41449	Borgin	280	" No , of course I would n't , you stupid , little man , how would I look carrying that down the street ? Just do n't sell it . "
41590	41599	41600	41600	Borgin	280	" Of course not . . . sir . "
41618	41635	41613	41613	him	280	" Not a word to anyone , Borgin , and that includes my mother , understand ? "
41636	41641	41643	41643	Borgin	280	" Naturally , naturally , "
41711	41717	41719	41719	Ron	217	" What was that about ? "
41727	41730	41732	41732	Harry	136	" Dunno , "
41737	41772	41732	41732	Harry	136	" He wants something mended . . . and he wants to reserve something in there . . . . Could you see what he pointed at when he said ' that one ' ? "
41773	41782	41791	41791	Hermione	194	" No , he was behind that cabinet — "
41783	41789	41791	41791	Hermione	194	" You two stay here , "
41793	41799	41791	41791	Hermione	194	" What are you — ? "
41853	41863	41864	41864	Hermione	194	" Hello , horrible morning , is n't it ? "
41895	41902	41903	41903	she	194	" Is this necklace for sale ? "
41914	41926	41928	41929	Mr. Borgin	280	" If you 've got one and a half thousand Galleons , "
41932	41947	41949	41949	Hermione	194	" Oh — er — no , I have n't got quite that much , "
41954	41968	41949	41949	Hermione	194	" And . . . what about this lovely — um — skull ? "
41969	41973	41995	41996	Mr. Borgin	280	" Sixteen Galleons . "
41974	41994	41995	41996	Mr. Borgin	280	" So it 's for sale , then ? It is n't being . . . kept for anyone ? "
42032	42095	42024	42024	she	194	" The thing is , that — er — boy who was in here just now , Draco Malfoy , well , he 's a friend of mine , and I want to get him a birthday present , but if he 's already reserved anything , I obviously do n't want to get him the same thing , so ... um ... "
42114	42117	42118	42118	he	280	" Out , "
42122	42126	42118	42118	he	280	" Get out ! "
42166	42170	42172	42172	Ron	217	" Ah well , "
42181	42193	42172	42172	Ron	217	" Worth a try , but you were a bit obvious — "
42194	42212	42213	42213	she	194	" Well , next time you can show me how it 's done , Master of Mystery ! "
42415	42428	42430	42430	Hermione	194	" Yes , I 've already agreed it was fishy , Harry , "
42472	42486	42435	42435	She	194	" But have n't we agreed there could be a lot of explanations ? "
42487	42496	42498	42498	Ron	217	" Maybe he 's broken his Hand of Glory "
42513	42523	42498	42498	Ron	217	" Remember that shriveled - up arm Malfoy had ? "
42524	42543	42545	42545	Harry	136	" But what about when he said , ' Do n't forget to keep that one safe ' ? "
42551	42572	42545	42545	Harry	136	" That sounded to me like Borgin 's got another one of the broken objects , and Malfoy wants both . "
42573	42577	42579	42579	Ron	217	" You reckon ? "
42592	42598	42600	42600	Harry	136	" Yeah , I do , "
42612	42628	42609	42609	he	136	" Malfoy 's father 's in Azkaban . Do n't you think Malfoy’d like revenge ? "
42635	42647	42629	42629	Ron	217	" Malfoy , revenge ? What can he do about it ? "
42648	42659	42661	42661	Harry	136	" That 's my point , I do n't know ! "
42665	42717	42718	42718	Harry	136	" But he 's up to something and I think we should take it seriously . His father 's a Death Eater and ? quot ; Harry broke off , his eyes fixed on the window behind Hermione , his mouth open . A startling thought had just occurred to him . "
42720	42728	42718	42718	Harry	136	" said Hermione in an anxious voice . "
42733	42734	42718	42718	Harry	136	" "
42745	42750	42751	42751	He	217	" asked Ron nervously . "
42757	42762	42763	42763	He	217	" said Harry slowly . "
42773	42785	42763	42763	He	217	" There was a silence ; then Ron erupted in laughter . "
42806	42807	42796	42796	You	217	" "
42815	42825	42813	42813	Harry	136	" said Hermione in a repressive sort of voice . "
42832	42833	42828	42828	you	217	" "
42879	42888	42870	42870	He	170	" Ron and Hermione looked at each other . "
42892	42900	42870	42870	He	170	" said Ron , sounding thoroughly unconvinced . "
42914	42918	42912	42912	Harry	136	" said Hermione . "
42928	42934	42919	42919	He	170	" Harry pressed on stubbornly . "
42968	42976	42950	42950	he	170	" Ron and Hermione exchanged another look . "
42987	42988	42982	42982	Harry	136	" "
43008	43074	43075	43075	I	0	" Annoyed , but absolutely convinced he was right , Harry snatched up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room ; Mrs. Weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment . On the landing he bumped into Ginny , who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes . "
43085	43090	43075	43075	I	0	" she warned him . "
43099	43100	43101	43101	I	0	" "
43111	43164	43168	43168	Bill	241	" Harry smiled . Sure enough , when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at the kitchen table , in full flow about plans for her wedding to Bill , while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of self - peeling sprouts , looking bad - tempered . "
43214	43219	43221	43222	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Ah , Harry ! "
43231	43268	43221	43222	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Good , I wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow . We 've got Ministry cars again , and there will be Aurors waiting at the station ? quot ; "
43276	43286	43221	43222	Mrs. Weasley	218	" asked Harry , handing over his Quidditch things . "
43306	43307	43308	43308	She	238	" "
43318	43334	43308	43308	She	238	" Fleur mused , examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon . "
43342	43348	43350	43351	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Yes , thank you , "
43359	43390	43350	43351	Mrs. Weasley	218	" You 'd better get on , Harry , I want the trunks ready tonight , if possible , so we do n't have the usual last - minute scramble . "
43461	43468	43470	43470	Fleur	238	" Au revoir , ' Any , "
43575	43584	43586	43587	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Quick , quick , through the barrier , "
43599	43643	43586	43587	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Harry had better go first , with ? quot ; She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors , who nodded briefly , seized Harry 's upper arm , and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten . "
43650	43747	43748	43748	We	1406	" said Harry irritably , jerking his arm out of the Auror 's grip . He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier , ignoring his silent companion , and found himself , a second later , standing on platform nine and three - quarters , where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd . Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds . Without waiting to consult his grim - faced Auror , Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform , looking for an empty compartment . "
43754	43761	43752	43752	Harry	136	" said Hermione , looking apologetic . "
43784	43785	43764	43764	I	0	" "
43792	43796	43764	43764	I	0	" said Harry . "
43820	43829	43810	43810	you	1410	" said Mrs. Weasley , consulting her watch . "
43842	43843	43837	43837	Ron	217	" "
43854	43869	43844	43845	Mr. Weasley	220	" said Harry , making up his mind on the spur of the moment . "
43873	43984	43844	43845	Mr. Weasley	220	" said Mr. Weasley , who looked slightly surprised , but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless . Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that , if he was to tell anyone , Mr. Weasley was the right person ; firstly , because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations , and secondly , because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr. Weasley exploding with anger . He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim - faced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away . "
43992	44005	44007	44007	I	0	" Harry began , but Mr. Weasley forestalled him with a grimace . "
44037	44038	44041	44041	you	0	" "
44044	44045	44046	44046	Harry	136	" "
44062	44063	44050	44050	You	136	" "
44081	44082	44073	44073	we	1412	" "
44094	44095	44073	44073	we	1412	" "
44109	44110	44103	44103	We	1412	" "
44128	44129	44112	44112	you	0	" "
44139	44154	44131	44131	I	0	" said Harry , disregarding Mr. Weasley 's look of mingled exasperation and amusement . "
44169	44170	44163	44163	I	0	" "
44176	44184	44173	44173	you	0	" said Mr. Weasley , sounding resigned . "
44193	44194	44195	44195	He	170	" "
44202	44206	44195	44195	He	170	" said Harry , "
44260	44267	44236	44236	He	170	" Harry took a deep breath . "
44313	44326	44327	44327	Harry	136	" Mr. Weasley looked taken aback . After a moment he said , "
44348	44365	44367	44367	Harry	136	" Does anyone really know what You - Know - Who would or would n't do ? "
44370	44414	44367	44367	Harry	136	" Mr. Weasley , I 'm sorry , but is n't it worth investigating ? If Malfoy wants something fixing , and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done , it 's probably something Dark or dangerous , is n't it ? "
44415	44426	44428	44429	Mr. Weasley	220	" I doubt it , to be honest , Harry , "
44432	44457	44428	44429	Mr. Weasley	220	" You see , when Lucius Malfoy was arrested , we raided his house . We took away everything that might have been dangerous . "
44458	44465	44467	44467	Harry	136	" I think you missed something , "
44470	44475	44477	44478	Mr. Weasley	220	" Well , maybe , "
44510	44526	44527	44527	Harry	136	" You 'd better hurry ! ' said Mr. Weasley , as Mrs. Weasley cried , "
44531	44549	44527	44527	Harry	136	" He hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train . "
44577	44600	44601	44601	You	136	" said Mrs. Weasley through the window , as Harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move . "
44618	44635	44601	44601	You	136	" ? be good and ? quot ; , She was jogging to keep up now . "
44640	44757	44601	44601	You	136	" Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were lost to view , then turned to see where the others had got to . He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the prefects ' carriage , but Ginny was a little way along the corridor , chatting to some friends . He made his way toward her , dragging his trunk . People stared shamelessly as he approached . They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him . He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the "
44760	44789	44601	44601	You	136	" rumors in the Daily Prophet , but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight . He tapped Ginny on the shoulder . "
44797	44798	44799	44799	I	0	" "
44812	44817	44805	44805	I	0	" said Ginny brightly . "
44822	44823	44819	44819	you	136	" "
44826	44897	44819	44819	you	136	" said Harry . He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away , her long red hair dancing behind her ; he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him , Ron , and Hermione while at school . Then he blinked and looked around : He was surrounded by mesmerized girls . "
44902	44911	44912	44912	Neville	174	" said a familiar voice from behind him . "
44914	44932	44935	44935	Harry	136	" said Harry in relief , turning to see a round - faced boy struggling toward him . "
44937	44955	44935	44935	Harry	136	" said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes , who was just behind Neville . "
44964	44965	44962	44962	you	136	" "
44972	45001	45002	45002	Quibbler	289	" said Luna . She was clutching a magazine to her chest ; large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside . "
45009	45032	45002	45002	Quibbler	289	" asked Harry , who felt a certain fondness for the magazine , having given it an exclusive interview the previous year . "
45041	45046	45096	45096	Neville	174	" said Luna happily . "
45052	45087	45088	45088	They	1431	" said Harry , and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students . At last they found an empty compartment , and Harry hurried inside gratefully . "
45103	45110	45096	45096	Neville	174	" Because we 're with you ! "
45111	45125	45127	45127	Harry	136	" They 're staring at you because you were at the Ministry too , "
45139	45157	45127	45127	Harry	136	" Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet , you must 've seen it . "
45158	45172	45174	45174	Neville	174	" Yes , I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity , "
45176	45206	45207	45207	He	174	" but she was really pleased . Says I 'm starting to live up to my dad at long last . She bought me a new wand , look ! "
45217	45223	45224	45224	he	174	" Cherry and unicorn hair , "
45228	45254	45224	45224	he	174	" We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold , he vanished next day ? oi , come back here , Trevor ! "
45276	45288	45290	45290	Luna	288	" Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year , Harry ? "
45307	45321	45323	45323	Harry	136	" No point now we 've got rid of Umbridge , is there ? "
45347	45359	45342	45342	He	174	" I liked the D.A. ! I learned loads with you ! "
45360	45367	45369	45369	Luna	288	" I enjoyed the meetings too , "
45372	45379	45369	45369	Luna	288	" It was like having friends . "
45439	45444	45447	45447	you	136	" You ask him ! "
45449	45455	45459	45459	them	1433	" I 'll do it ! "
45486	45498	45499	45499	she	1436	" Hi , Harry , I 'm Romilda , Romilda Vane , "
45505	45525	45526	45526	she	1436	" Why do n't you join us in our compartment ? You do n't have to sit with them , "
45577	45584	45586	45586	Harry	136	" They 're friends of mine , "
45589	45592	45594	45595	the girl	1349	" Oh , "
45601	45606	45608	45608	she	1349	" Oh . Okay . "
45618	45629	45631	45631	Luna	288	" People expect you 10 have cooler friends than us , "
45642	45647	45649	45649	Harry	136	" You are cool , "
45652	45668	45649	45649	Harry	136	" None of them was at the Ministry . They did n't fight with me . "
45669	45679	45681	45681	Luna	288	" That 's a very nice thing to say , "
45700	45709	45711	45711	Neville	174	" We did n't face him , though , "
45735	45821	45711	45711	Neville	174	" You did . You should hear my gran talk about you . ' That Harry Potter 's got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together ! ' She 'd give anything to have you as a grand - son . . . . Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to OWL . results as soon as he could . While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Transfiguration NEWT , with only an "
45824	45969	45711	45711	Neville	174	" Harry watched him without really listening . Neville 's childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as much as Harry 's had , but Neville had no idea how close he had come to having Harry 's destiny . The prophecy could have referred to either of them , yet , for his own inscrutable reasons , Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant . Had Voldemort chosen Neville , it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightning - shaped scar and the weight of the prophecy . ... Or would it ? Would Neville ’s mother have died to save him , as Lily had died for Harry ? Surely she would . . . . But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort ? Would there then have been no "
45972	46004	46005	46005	You	1438	" at all ? An empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed good - bye by his own mother , not Ron 's ? "
46015	46022	46011	46011	You	1438	" said Neville . Harry started . "
46029	46034	46036	46036	Luna	288	" Wrackspurt got you ? "
46048	46053	46036	46036	Luna	288	" I — what ? "
46054	46077	46078	46078	she	288	" A Wrackspurt . . . They 're invisible . They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy , "
46081	46092	46093	46093	She	288	" I thought I felt one zooming around in here . "
46186	46199	46201	46201	Ron	217	" Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up , I 'm starving , "
46215	46227	46228	46228	he	217	" Hi , Neville . Hi , Luna . Guess what ? "
46235	46262	46228	46228	he	217	" Malfoy s not doing prefect duty . He 's just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins , we saw him when we passed . "
46297	46307	46228	46228	he	217	" What did he do when he saw you ? "
46308	46312	46314	46314	Ron	217	" The usual , "
46323	46337	46339	46339	he	170	" Not like him , though , is it ? Well ? that is "
46346	46358	46339	46339	he	170	" but why is n't he out there bullying first years ? "
46361	46390	46339	46339	he	170	" said Harry , but his mind was racing . Did n't this look as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students ? "
46398	46402	46392	46392	he	170	" said Hermione . "
46414	46415	46416	46416	I	0	" "
46422	46426	46427	46427	I	0	" said Harry . "
46459	46475	46476	46476	she	1446	" I 'm supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry P - Potter , "
46526	46531	46532	46532	Ron	217	" What is it ? "
46540	46544	46546	46546	Harry.?/p	297	" An invitation , "
46572	46581	46588	46588	he	174	" But what does he want me for ? "
46593	46597	46599	46599	Harry	136	" No idea , "
46619	46622	46623	46623	he	136	" Listen , "
46633	46662	46623	46623	he	136	" let 's go under the Invisibility Cloak , then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way , see what he 's up to . "
46863	46868	46870	46870	Slughorn	193	" Harry , m'boy ! "
46920	46938	46939	46939	Neville	174	" Good to see you , good to see you ! And you must be Mr. Longbottom ! "
47036	47044	47045	47045	Slughorn	193	" Now , do you know everyone ? "
47051	47063	47045	47045	Slughorn	193	" Blaise Zabini is in your year , of course - ? "
47091	47108	47109	47109	McLaggen	302	" This is Cormac McLaggen , perhaps you 've come across each other ? ? No ? "
47132	47147	47126	47126	Neville	174	" ? and this is Marcus Belby , I do n't know whether ? ? "
47163	47176	47177	47177	Slughorn	193	" ? and this charming young lady tells me she knows you ! "
47192	47201	47203	47203	Slughorn	193	" Well now , this is most pleasant , "
47206	47269	47203	47203	Slughorn	193	" A chance to get to know you all a little better . Here , take a napkin . I 've packed my own lunch ; the trolley , as I remember it , is heavy on licorice wands , and a poor old man 's digestive system is n't quite up to such things . . . . Pheasant , Belby ? "
47282	47301	47302	47302	Slughorn	193	" I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles , "
47316	47342	47302	47302	Slughorn	193	" Outstanding wizard , outstanding , and his Order of Merlin most well - deserved . Do you see much of your uncle , Marcus ? "
47374	47377	47379	47379	Slughorn	193	" Anapneo , "
47396	47408	47410	47410	Belby	303	" Not . . . not much of him , no , "
47416	47428	47430	47430	Slughorn	193	" Well , of course , I daresay he 's busy , "
47437	47450	47430	47430	Slughorn	193	" I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work ! "
47451	47457	47459	47459	Belby	303	" I suppose . . . "
47481	47507	47508	47508	His	303	" Er ... he and my dad do n't get on very well , you see , so I do n't really know much about ... "
47525	47532	47534	47534	Slughorn	193	" Now , you , Cormac , "
47536	47571	47534	47534	Slughorn	193	" I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius , because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in , I think , Norfolk ? "
47572	47584	47586	47586	McLaggen	302	" Oh , yeah , that was fun , that was , "
47588	47609	47586	47586	McLaggen	302	" We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour ? this was before he became Minister , obviously ? quot ; "
47619	47639	47612	47612	you	302	" beamed Slughorn , now offering around a small tray of pies ; somehow , Belby was missed out . "
47646	47799	47612	47612	you	302	" It was as Harry had suspected . Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody well - known or influential ? everyone except Ginny . Zabini , who was interrogated after McLaggen , turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother ( from what Harry could make out , she had been married seven times , each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold ) . It was Neville 's turn next : This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes , for Neville 's parents , well - known Aurors , had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies . At the end of Neville 's interview , Harry had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on Neville , yet to see whether he had any of his parents ' flair . "
47803	47823	47824	47825	Harry Potter	136	" said Slughorn , shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act . "
47845	47868	47870	47872	The Chosen One	940	" He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant , then said , "
47881	47898	47875	47875	they	1472	" Harry said nothing . Belby , McLaggen , and Zabini were all staring at him . "
47902	47910	47875	47875	they	1472	" said Slughorn , watching Harry closely , "
47977	47994	48001	48001	Slughorn	193	" Yeah , Zabini , because you 're so talented ... at posing . . . . "
47995	47999	48001	48001	Slughorn	193	" Oh dear ! "
48020	48055	48056	48056	Zabini	301	" You want to be careful , Blaise ! I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous Bat - Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage ! I would n't cross her ! "
48061	48064	48066	48066	Slughorn	193	" Anyway , "
48073	48135	48066	48066	Slughorn	193	" Such rumors this summer . Of course , one does n't know what to believe , the Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies , make mistakes ? but there seems little doubt , given the number of witnesses , that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all ! "
48162	48213	48157	48157	Slughorn	193	" So modest , so modest , no wonder Dumbledore is so fond ? you were there , then ? But the rest of the stories ? so sensational , of course , one does n't know quite what to believe ? this fabled prophecy , for instance ? quot ; "
48220	48232	48214	48214	We	1473	" said Neville , turning geranium pink as he said it . "
48237	48242	48243	48243	Neville	174	" said Ginny staunchly . "
48269	48270	48261	48262	the Prophet	5056	" "
48280	48306	48278	48278	you	1475	" said Slughorn with great interest , looking from Ginny to Neville , but both of them sat clam - like before his encouraging smile . "
48328	48337	48317	48318	the Prophet	5056	" Slughorn said , sounding a little disappointed . "
48425	48428	48422	48422	he	193	" Slug Club "
48474	48539	48540	48540	he	193	" Good gracious , it 's getting dark already ! I did n't notice that they 'd lit the lamps ! You 'd better go and change into your robes , all of you . McLaggen , you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails . Harry , Blaise ? any time you 're passing . Same goes for you , miss , "
48545	48556	48558	48558	he	193	" Well , off you go , off you go ! "
48592	48600	48602	48602	Neville	174	" I 'm glad that 's over , "
48604	48612	48602	48602	Neville	174	" Strange man , is n't he ? "
48613	48621	48623	48623	Harry	136	" Yeah , he is a bit , "
48630	48641	48625	48625	his	136	" How come you ended up in there , Ginny ? "
48642	48650	48652	48652	Ginny	236	" He saw me hex Zacharias Smith , "
48654	48726	48652	48652	Ginny	236	" You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A. ? He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him ? when Slughorn came in I thought I was going to got detention , but he just thought it was ; i really good hex and invited me to lunch ! Mad , eh ? "
48727	48740	48742	48742	Harry	136	" Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother 's famous , "
48753	48891	48742	48742	Harry	136	" or because their uncle ? quot ; But he broke off . An idea had just occurred to him , a reckless but potentially wonderful idea . ... In a minute 's time , Zabini was going to reenter the Slytherin sixth - year compartment and Malfoy would be sitting there , thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherins . ... If Harry could only enter , unseen , behind him , what might he not see or hear ? True , there was little of the journey left ? Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an hour away , judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows ? but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harry 's suspicions seriously , so it was down to him to prove them . "
48899	48917	48652	48652	Ginny	236	" said Harry under his breath , pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself . "
48924	48928	48921	48921	you	1483	" asked Neville . "
48931	49031	48921	48921	you	1483	" whispered Harry , darting after Zabini as quietly as possible , though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless . The corridors were almost completely empty now . Nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions . Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without touching him , Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the door . Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing . "
49039	49301	49304	49304	Zabini	301	" said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry 's foot . Harry seized the door and pushed it open , hard ; Zabini , still clinging on to the handle , toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyle 's lap , and in the ensuing ruckus , Harry darted into the compartment , leapt onto Zabini 's temporarily empty seat , and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack . It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each other , drawing all eyes onto them , for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them ; indeed , for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoy 's eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight . But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him ; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled , Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic , and Malfoy , sniggering , lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap . Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden , and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoy 's forehead , smirking as she did so , as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place . The lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene : Harry could read every word of Crabbe 's comic directly below him . "
49306	49310	49304	49304	Zabini	301	" said Malfoy , "
49316	49317	49313	49313	Slughorn	193	" "
49329	49340	49343	49343	he	193	" said Zabini , who was still glowering at Goyle . "
49349	49359	49343	49343	he	193	" This information did not seem to please Malfoy . "
49366	49370	49371	49371	McLaggen	302	" he demanded . "
49375	49379	49371	49371	McLaggen	302	" said Zabini . "
49391	49395	49383	49384	his uncle	4586	" said Malfoy . "
49407	49416	49418	49418	Pansy	314	" Not him , he 's a prat ! "
49420	49432	49434	49434	Zabini	301	" ? and Longbottom , Potter , and that Weasley girl , "
49448	49454	49436	49436	Malfoy	170	" He invited Longbottom ? . "
49455	49467	49469	49469	Zabini	301	" Well , I assume so , as Longbottom was there , "
49472	49481	49469	49469	Zabini	301	" What 's Longbottom got to interest Slughorn ? "
49485	49503	49482	49482	Zabini	301	" Potter , precious Potter , obviously he wanted a look at ' the Chosen One , ' "
49507	49520	49505	49505	Malfoy	170	" but that Weasley girl ! What 's so special about her??/p > "
49528	49545	49524	49524	boys	1488	" said Pansy , watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction . "
49572	49589	49591	49591	Zabini	301	" I would n't touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like , "
49616	49676	49599	49599	Malfoy	170	" Well , I pity Slughorn 's taste . Maybe he 's going a bit senile . Shame , my father always said he was a good wizard in his day . My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his . Slughorn probably has n't heard I 'm on the train , or ? quot ; "
49685	49689	49690	49690	He	170	" said Zabini . "
49749	49762	49742	49742	Slughorn	193	" Malfoy looked angry , but forced out a singularly humorless laugh . "
49789	49794	49785	49787	some stupid teacher	1498	" Malfoy yawned ostentatiously . "
49826	49827	49815	49820	some fat old has - been	1499	" "
49842	49853	49830	49830	you	0	" said Pansy indignantly , ceasing grooming Malfoy at once . "
49860	49870	49830	49830	you	0	" said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk . "
49885	49964	49966	49966	you	0	" Crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak , Harry 's heart began to race . What would Ron and Hermione say about this ? Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy ; apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things . Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features . Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy s hair , looking dumbfounded . "
49969	49973	49966	49966	you	0	“ Malfoy shrugged . "
50047	50048	50027	50027	he	4469	" "
50062	50067	50050	50050	you	0	" asked Zabini scathingly . "
50078	50079	50080	50080	I	0	" "
50118	50154	50102	50102	he	4469	" said Malfoy quietly . Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles . Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so awe - inspiring . "
50160	50180	50158	50158	Hogwarts	14	" said Malfoy , clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window . "
50189	50431	50432	50432	You	1504	" Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy , he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk ; as he swung it down , it hit Harry hard on the side of the head . He let out an involuntary gasp of pain , and Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack , frowning . Harry was not afraid of Malfoy , but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins . Eyes still watering and head still throbbing , he drew his wand , careful not to disarrange the cloak , and waited , breath held . To his relief , Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise ; he pulled on his robes like the others , locked his trunk , and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl , fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck . Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him ; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied . At last , with a final lurch , the train came to a complete halt . Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out into a crowd of second years , punching them aside ; Crabbe and Zabini followed . "
50436	50459	50432	50432	You	1504	" Malfoy told Pansy , who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it . "
50467	50572	50460	50460	I	0	" Pansy left . Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment . People were filing past , descending onto the dark platform . Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds , so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in . He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again . Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack , his heart pumping a little faster . What had Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy ? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend ? "
50576	50664	50460	50460	I	0	" Without warning , Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry , who was instantly paralyzed . As though in slow motion , he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell , with an agonizing , floor - shaking crash , at Malfoy 's feet , the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him , his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position . He could n't move a muscle ; he could only gaze up at Malfoy , who smiled broadly . "
50669	50674	50665	50665	I	0	" he said jubilantly . "
50702	50714	50695	50695	Zabini	301	" His eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry 's trainers . "
50736	50759	50731	50731	you	1505	" -=-Him And he stamped , hard , on Harry 's face . Harry felt his nose break ; blood spurted everywhere . "
50775	50793	50794	50794	I	0	" Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry 's immobilized body and threw it over him . "
50809	50814	50798	50798	they	1507	" he said quietly . "
50824	50839	50819	50819	Potter	136	" And taking care to tread on Harry 's fingers , Malfoy left the compartment .
51128	51132	51181	51181	he	319	" Accio Wand ! "
51324	51329	51338	51338	Harry	136	" Wotcher , Harry . "
51403	51425	51393	51393	We	1530	" she said , as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station . "
51433	51544	51393	51393	We	1530	" Harry hurried after her into the corridor . She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform , which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum . He followed her , staggered a little on landing , then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed , round the corner , and disappear from view . The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose . Tonks was looking at him ; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position . Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak . “
51549	51550	51551	51552	Draco Malfoy	170	" “
51554	51559	51551	51552	Draco Malfoy	170	” said Harry bitterly . "
51565	51566	51393	51393	We	1530	" “
51570	51609	51393	51393	We	1530	” said Tonks , without smiling . From what Harry could see in the darkness , she was as mousy - haired and miserable - lookinng as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow . "
51620	51676	51610	51610	I	0	" Harry did not think much of this idea ; he had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey , the matron , in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells , but it seemed rude to say this , so he stayed stock - still and closed his eyes , “
51678	51708	51610	51610	I	0	" said Tonks . Harry ’s nose felt very hot , and then very cold . He raised a hand and felt gingerly . It seemed to be mended . “
51713	51714	51715	51715	You	1531	" “
51733	51777	51779	51779	Harry	136	" said Tonks , still unsmiling . As Harry swung the cloak back over himself , she waved her wand ; an immense silvery four - legged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness . '' Was that a Patronus ? "
51790	51819	51779	51779	Harry	136	" Yes , I 'm sending word to the castle that I 've got you or they 'll worry . Come on , we 'd better not dawdle . "
51832	51839	51779	51779	Harry	136	" How did you find me ? "
51840	51884	51779	51779	Harry	136	" I noticed you had n't left the train and I knew you had that cloak . I thought you might be hiding for some reason . When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought I ’d check . "
51885	51895	51896	51896	Harry	136	" But what are you doing here , anyway ? "
51899	51914	51916	51916	Tonks	226	" I 'm stationed in Hogsmeade now , to give the school extra protection , "
51918	51932	51916	51916	Tonks	226	" Is it just you who 's stationed up here , or — ? "
51933	51946	51984	51984	Tonks	226	" No , Proudfoot , Savage , and Dawlish are here too . "
51947	51957	51916	51916	Tonks	226	" Dawlish , that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year ? "
51958	51963	51964	51964	They	1536	" That 's right . "
52229	52232	52233	52233	he	136	“ Alohomora ! "
52248	52256	52258	52258	Tonks	226	“ That wo n't work on these , "
52260	52266	52258	52258	Tonks	226	" Dumbledore bewitched them himself . "
52277	52281	52267	52267	Harry	136	" he suggested . “
52288	52293	52284	52284	you	136	" said Tonks flatly . "
52312	52313	52284	52284	you	136	" “
52317	52331	52284	52284	you	136	” said Harry , starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness , “
52347	52348	52349	52349	Someone	5066	” “
52356	52360	52349	52349	Someone	5066	" said Tonks , "
52363	52466	52349	52349	Someone	5066	" A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle . Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filch 's wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews . It was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them , and had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be seen , that he recognized , with a rush of pure loathing , the uplit hooked nose and long , black , greasy hair of Severus Snape . "
52473	52499	52349	52349	Someone	5066	" sneered Snape , taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once , so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open . "
52526	52527	52510	52510	you	136	" "
52539	52549	52537	52537	my	0	" Harry began , but Snape cut across him . "
52570	52571	52572	52572	I	0	" "
52580	52586	52572	52572	I	0	" said Tonks , frowning . "
52613	52626	52605	52605	I	0	" said Snape , standing back to allow Harry to pass him , "
52636	52668	52632	52634	your new Patronus	1545	" He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again , so that they slithered , clinking , back into place . "
52680	52691	52669	52669	I	0	" said Snape , the malice in his voice unmistakable . "
52698	52731	52692	52694	The new one	1547	" As Snape swung the lantern about , Harry saw , fleetingly , a look of shock and anger on Tonks 's face . Then she was covered in darkness once more . "
52735	52756	52692	52694	The new one	1547	" Harry called to her over his shoulder , as he began the walk up to the school with Snape . "
52762	52763	52765	52765	you	136	" "
52769	52944	52767	52767	Harry	136	" Snape did not speak for a minute or so . Harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredibie that Snape could not feel them burning him . He had loathed Snape from their first encounter , but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry 's forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius . Whatever Dumbledore said , Harry had had time to think over the summer , and had concluded that Snape 's snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died . Harry clung to this notion , because it enabled him to blame Snape , which felt satisfying , and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead , it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness . “
52955	52959	52952	52952	I	0	" said Snape . “
53010	53046	53008	53008	Potter	136	" The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white - hot , but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to London than tell Snape why he was late . “
53059	53063	53057	53057	you	1548	" Snape continued . "
53089	53230	53070	53070	you	1548	" Still Harry remained silent , though he thought his chest might explode . He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this , for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else listening . They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall , a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hail . Harry wondered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on , thereby gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table ( which , inconveniently , was the farthest from the entrance hall ) without being noticed . As though he had read Harry 's mind , however , Snape said , "
53254	53379	53382	53382	you	1555	" Harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors : anything to get away from Snape . The Great Hall with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of the room , was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow . It was ail a shimmering blur to Harry , however , who walked so fast that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare , and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him , he had spotted Ron and Hermione , sped along the benches toward them , .mil forced his way in between them . "
53394	53410	53388	53388	you	1555	" said Ron , goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity . I "
53419	53433	53434	53434	You	1555	" said Harry , grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection . "
53440	53444	53434	53434	You	1555	" said Hermione . "
53448	53455	53434	53434	You	1555	" She raised her wand , said "
53458	53466	53434	53434	You	1555	" and siphoned off the dried blood . "
53469	53479	53434	53434	You	1555	" said Harry , feeling his now clean face . "
53486	53489	53491	53491	Hermoine	329	“ Normal , "
53494	53510	53491	53491	Hermoine	329	" Why should n't it ? Harry , what happened ? We 've been terrified ! "
53511	53518	53520	53520	Harry	136	“ I 'll tell you later , "
53558	53561	53563	53563	Hermione	194	“ But — "
53565	53571	53573	53573	Harry	136	“ Not now , Hermione , "
53668	53676	53678	53678	Hermione	194	“ You missed the Sorting , anyway , "
53689	53695	53697	53697	Harry	136	“ Hat say anything interesting ? "
53706	53729	53697	53697	Harry	136	“ More of the same , really . . . advising us all to unite in the face enemies , you know . "
53730	53737	53742	53742	he	136	“ Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all ? "
53764	53765	53766	53766	Snape	156	" “
53775	53776	53766	53766	Snape	156	" “
53785	53794	53797	53797	him	156	" said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau . "
53799	53804	53797	53797	him	156	" said Harry evasively . "
53813	53817	53805	53805	Hagrid	218	" said Hermione . "
53828	54098	53826	53826	Harry	136	" Harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid , who was indeed waving at him . Hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall , Head of Gryffindor House , the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagrid 's elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side , and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting . Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher , Professor Trelawney , sitting on Hagrid 's other side ; she rarely left her tower room , and he had never seen her at the start - of - term feast before . She looked as odd as ever , glittering with beads and trailing shawls , her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles . Having always considered her a bit of a fraud , Harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harry 's parents and attack Harry himself . The knowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company , thankfully , this year he would be dropping Divination . Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction ; he hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table . Draco Malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause . Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart , his insides burning again . What he would give to fight Malfoy one - on - one ... "
54106	54110	54102	54103	Professor Slughorn	216	" Hermione asked . "
54120	54124	54125	54125	Him	216	" said Harry . "
54131	54135	54125	54125	Him	216	" sniffed Hermione . "
54152	54153	54150	54150	Ron	217	" "
54156	54160	54161	54161	All	1565	" said Ron . "
54175	54176	54161	54161	All	1565	" "
54191	54213	54214	54214	I	0	" interrupted Nearly Headless Nick , inclining his barely connected head toward Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff . "
54279	54280	54264	54264	I	0	" “
54294	54298	54302	54302	you	217	" Ron observed . “
54312	54362	54302	54302	you	217	" said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones , and he rose into the air glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table . The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly . "
54371	54390	54302	54302	you	217	" he said , smiling broadly , his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room . “
54397	54465	54302	54302	you	217	" gasped Hermione . She was not the only one who had noticed . Dumbledore 's right hand was as blackened and dead - looking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys . Whispers it the room ; Dumbledore , interpreting them correctly , merely smiled and shook his purple - and - gold sleeve over his injury . “
54471	54476	54302	54302	you	217	" he said airily . "
54504	54505	54506	54506	His	136	" "
54519	54525	54514	54514	him	136	" Harry whispered to Hermione . "
54545	54546	54539	54540	Madam Pomfrey	320	" "
54555	54564	54539	54540	Madam Pomfrey	320	" said Hermione , with a nauseated expression . "
54588	54589	54594	54595	Mr. Filch	327	" "
54625	54661	54662	54662	We	1570	" Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads of House as usual . We are also looking for new Quidditch commentators , who should do likewise . "
54677	54701	54761	54761	you	0	" — Slughorn stood up , his bald head gleaming in the candlelight , his big waistcoated belly casting the table into shadow — "
54719	54720	54716	54717	Potions master	1576	" "
54723	54724	54716	54717	Potions master	1576	" "
54727	54744	54716	54717	Potions master	1576	" The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered wheel they had heard right . "
54747	54759	54761	54761	you	0	" said Ron and Hermione together , turning to stare Harry . "
54764	54765	54761	54761	you	0	" "
54771	54786	54766	54767	Professor Snape	221	" said Dumbledore , raising voice so that it carried over all the muttering , "
54800	54801	54873	54873	you	136	" "
54804	54869	54873	54873	you	136	" said Harry , so loudly that many heads turned in his direction . He did not care ; he was staring up at the staff table , incensed . How could Snape be given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job after all this time ? Had n't it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it ? “
54888	54892	54895	54895	he	216	" said Hermione . "
54898	54994	54895	54895	he	216	" said Harry , racking his brains to remember when Dumbledore had told him this , but now that he came to think of it , he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be teaching . Snape , who was sitting on Dumbledore 's right , did not stand up his mention of his name ; he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table , yet Harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much . “
55003	55008	55009	55009	Snape'll	334	" he said savagely . "
55019	55020	55009	55009	Snape'll	334	" “
55026	55030	55023	55023	you	1578	" asked Ron . “
55073	55074	55075	55075	Harry	136	" “
55077	55085	55086	55086	He	334	" said Hermione , shocked and reproachful . “
55100	55105	55086	55086	He	334	" said Ron reasonably . "
55122	55123	55126	55126	his	146	" “
55205	55230	55182	55182	Dumbledore	146	" Now , as everybody in this Hall knows , Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength . "
55278	55442	55443	55443	Dumbledore	146	" I can not emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is , and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe . The castle ’s magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer , we are protected in new and more powerful ways , but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff . I urge you , therefore , to abide by any security restrictions that you teachers might impose upon you , however irksome you might find them — in particular , the rule that you are not to be out of after hours . I implore you , should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle , to report it to a member of staff immediately . I trust you to conduct yourselves , always , with the utmost regard for your own and others ' safety . "
55457	55503	55452	55452	he	146	" But now , your beds await , as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish , and I know that your top priority is to be well - rested for your lessons tomorrow . Let us therefore say good night . Pip pip ! "
55612	55620	55621	55621	he	217	“ What really happened to your nose ? "
55668	55680	55681	55681	he	217	“ I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose , "
55685	55694	55696	55696	Harry	136	“ Yeah , well , never mind that , "
55699	55717	55681	55681	he	217	" Listen to what he was saying before he found out I was there . . . . "
55718	55743	55749	55749	he	1593	“ Harry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoys boasts . With what Harry considered pure pigheadedness , however , Ron was unimpressed . “
55772	55773	55763	55763	You	136	" “
55792	55793	55794	55794	I	0	" “
55805	55825	55803	55803	Harry	136	" said a reproachful voice behind them . Harry looked over his shoulder to see Hagtid shaking his head . "
55831	55835	55826	55826	Dumbledore	146	" said Harry stubbornly “
55846	55851	55842	55842	Dumbledore	146	" said Hagrid mysteriously . “
55865	55866	55861	55861	I	0	" "
55874	55878	55861	55861	I	0	" said Harry . "
55884	55885	55881	55881	you	0	" "
55891	55896	55889	55889	Grawp	338	" said Hagrid happily . "
55943	55944	55936	55936	We	1598	" "
55947	56003	55936	55936	We	1598	" said Harry , taking care not to catch Ron 's eye ; the last time he had met Hagrid 's half - brother , a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots , his vocabulary had comprised five words , two of which he was unable to pronounce properly . "
56013	56018	56007	56007	he	338	" said Hagrid proudly . "
56037	56063	56023	56023	I	0	" Ron snorted loudly , but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze . They were now standing beside the oak front doors . "
56096	56136	56089	56089	Buck	340	” Raising an arm in cheery farewell , he headed out of the doors into the darkness . Harry and Ron looked at each other . Harry could tell that Ku| was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself . "
56149	56155	56147	56147	you	0	" Ron shook his head . "
56165	56172	56163	56163	you	0	" Harry shook his head too . "
56176	56180	56186	56186	she	194	" said Ron , "
56188	56219	56186	56186	she	194	" Harry shook his head again . Exactly what Hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject , he did not like to think .
56268	56282	56284	56284	Ron	217	" But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson , was n't he ? "
56293	56296	56297	56297	she	194	" Well , "
56301	56334	56297	56297	she	194	" I do n't know . ... It would be like Malfoy make himself seem more important than he is ... but that 's a big lie to tell . . . . "
56335	56338	56340	56340	Harry	136	" Exactly , "
56375	56382	56383	56383	Ron	217	" It 's rude to point , "
56438	56469	56435	56435	Ron	217	" I love being a sixth year . And were going to be getting free time this year . Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax . "
56470	56483	56485	56485	Hermione	194	" We 're going to need that time for studying , Ron ! "
56495	56502	56504	56504	Ron	217	" Yeah , but not today , "
56506	56519	56504	56504	Ron	217	" Today 's going to be a real doss , I reckon . "
56520	56524	56526	56526	Hermione	194	" Hold it ! "
56558	56567	56568	56568	she	194	" Fanged Frisbees banned , hand it over , "
56610	56621	56594	56594	Ron	217	" Excellent , I 've always wanted one of these . "
56722	56737	56738	56738	she	194	" But he ca n't really think we 'd continue Care of Magical Creatures ! "
56744	56765	56738	56738	she	194	" I mean , when has any of us expressed . . . you know . . . any enthusiasm ? "
56766	56775	56777	56777	Ron	217	" That 's it , though , innit ? "
56786	56823	56777	56777	Ron	217	" We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid . But he thinks we liked the stupid subject . D'ya reckon anyone 's going to go on to N.E.W.T. ? "
57002	57007	57008	57008	she	251	" Herbology , fine , "
57011	57084	57008	57008	she	251	" Professor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an ' Outstanding ' O.W.L. And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with ' Exceeds Expectations . ' But the problem is Transfiguration . I 'm sorry , Longbottom , but an ' Acceptable ' really is n't good enough to continue to N.E.W.T. level . Just do n't think you 'd be able to cope with the coursework . "
57100	57124	57090	57091	Professor McGonagall	251	" Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration , anyway ? I 've never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it . "
57132	57137	57125	57125	Neville	174	" my grandmother wants . "
57138	57141	57143	57144	Professot McGonagall	345	" Hmph , "
57146	57183	57143	57144	Professot McGonagall	345	" It 's high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she 's got , rather than the one she thinks she ought to have - particularly after what happened at the Ministry . "
57202	57243	57192	57193	Professor McGonagall	251	" I 'm sorry , Longbottom , but I can not let you into my N.E.W.T. class . I see that you have an ' Exceeds Expectations ' in Charm however - why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms ? "
57244	57254	57256	57256	Neville	174	" My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option , "
57258	57262	57264	57265	Professor McGonagall	251	" Take Charms , "
57267	57293	57264	57265	Professor McGonagall	251	" and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms O.W.L. , the subject is not necessarily worthless . "
57358	57371	57381	57381	her	251	" He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year , "
57396	57407	57408	57408	Parvati	346	" The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney . "
57420	57429	57431	57432	Professor McGonagall	251	" So , Potter , Potter . . . "
57443	57499	57438	57438	she	251	" Charms , Defense Against the Dark Arts , Herbology , Transfiguration ... all fine . I must say , I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark , Potter , very pleased . Now , why have n't you applied to continue with Potions ? I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror ? "
57500	57522	57431	57432	Professor McGonagall	251	" It was , but you told me I had to get an ' Outstanding ' in my O.W.L. , Professor . "
57523	57563	57438	57438	she	251	" And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject . Professor Slughorn , however , is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with ' Exceeds Expectations ' at O.W.L. Do you wish to proceed with Potions ? "
57564	57567	57569	57569	Harry	136	" Yes , "
57571	57584	57569	57569	Harry	136	" but I did n't buy the books or any ingredients or anything- "
57585	57599	57601	57602	Professor McGonagall	251	" I 'm sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some , "
57604	57654	57601	57602	Professor McGonagall	251	" Very well , Potter , here is your schedule . Oh , by the way- twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team . I shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure . "
57681	57684	57686	57686	Ron	217	" Look , "
57694	57722	57686	57686	Ron	217	" we 've got a free period now . . . and a free period after break . . . and after lunch . . . excellent . "
57764	57775	57776	57776	she	153	" I thought you 'd get that , well done , "
57791	57799	57776	57776	she	153	" Tell me when you call trials ! "
57800	57806	57808	57808	Harry	136	" Do n't be stupid , "
57810	57830	57808	57808	Harry	136	" you do n't need to try out , I watched you play for five years . . . . "
57831	57840	57841	57841	she	153	" You must n't start off like that , "
57845	57884	57841	57841	she	153	" For all you know , there 's someone much better than me out there . Good teams have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing the old faces , or letting in their friends . ... "
57979	57988	57989	57989	she	194	" We got so much homework for Runes , "
57999	58019	57989	57989	she	194	" A fifteen - inch essay , two translations , and I 've got to read these by Wednesday ! "
58020	58023	58025	58025	Ron	217	" Shame , "
58027	58031	58032	58032	she	194	" You wait , "
58036	58044	58032	58032	she	194	" I bet Snape gives us loads . "
58081	58084	58085	58085	he	221	" Inside , "
58169	58181	58183	58183	Snape	221	" I have not asked you to take out your books , "
58219	58234	58235	58235	His	221	" I wish to speak to you , and I want your fullest attention . "
58260	58275	58235	58235	His	221	" You have had five teachers in this subject so far , I believe . "
58359	58392	58394	58394	Snape	221	" Snape set off around the edge of the room , speaking now in a lower voice ; the class craned their necks to keep him in view . The Dark Arts , "
58396	58451	58394	58394	Snape	221	" are many , varied , ever - changing , and eternal . Fighting them is like fighting a many - headed monster , which , each time a neck is severed , sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before . You are fighting that which is unfixed , mutating , indestructible . "
58491	58495	58497	58497	Snape	221	" Your defenses , "
58503	58533	58497	58497	Snape	221	" must therefore be as flexible and inventive as rhe arts you seek to undo . These pictures - he indicated a few of them as he swept past - "
58552	58568	58497	58497	Snape	221	" - he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony - "
58574	58590	58497	58497	Snape	221	" - a wizard lying huddled and blank - eyed , slumped against a wall - "
58598	58606	58631	58631	he	1640	" - a bloody mass upon ground . "
58615	58625	58608	58609	an Inferius	1639	" said Parvati Patil in a high pitched voice . "
58635	58636	58631	58631	he	1640	" "
58647	58651	58631	58631	he	1640	" said Snape , "
58672	58706	58631	58631	he	1640	" He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk , and again , they watched him as he walked , his dark robes billowing behind him . , "
58734	58764	58768	58769	Miss Granger	194	" Hermione 's hand shot into the air . Snape took his time looking around at everybody else , making sure he had no choice , before saying curtly , "
58771	58772	58768	58769	Miss Granger	194	" "
58789	58793	58768	58769	Miss Granger	194	" said Hermione , "
58803	58804	58768	58769	Miss Granger	194	" "
58822	58836	58768	58769	Miss Granger	194	" said Snape dismissively ( over in the corner , Malfoy sniggered ) , "
58885	58896	58768	58769	Miss Granger	194	" - his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more - "
58899	58931	58932	58932	You	1647	" Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year . He refused to drop his gaze , but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away . "
58937	58942	58932	58932	You	1647	" Snape went on , "
58971	59172	59175	59175	Weasley	217	" Although Snape did not know it , Harry had taught at least half the class ( everyone who had been a member of the D.A. ) how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year . None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking , however . A reasonable amount of cheating ensued ; many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud . Typically , ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville 's muttered Jelly - Legs Jinx without uttering a single word , a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher , thought Harry bitterly , but which Snape ignored . He swept between them as they practiced , looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever , lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task . Ron , who was supposed to be jinxing Harry , was purple in the face , his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation . Harry had his wand raised , waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come . "
59177	59185	59175	59175	Weasley	217	" said Snape , after a while . "
59193	59217	59189	59189	me	0	" He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively ; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten , he yelled , "
59220	59254	59189	59189	me	0	" His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off - balance and hit a desk . The whole class had looked around and now watched as Snape righted himself , scowling . "
59269	59270	59258	59258	me	0	" "
59273	59278	59258	59258	me	0	" said Harry stiffly . "
59283	59284	59281	59281	sir	985	" "
59298	59334	59296	59296	Professor	221	" The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying . Several people gasped , including Hermione . Behind Snape , however , Ron , Dean , and Seam us grinned appreciatively . "
59343	59347	59340	59340	my	0	" said Snape . "
59368	59369	59363	59365	the Chosen One	940	" "
59376	59394	59374	59374	Harry	136	" chortled Ron , once they were safely on their way to break a short while later . "
59403	59411	59395	59395	You	136	" said Hermione , frowning at Ron . "
59416	59417	59418	59418	He	1656	" "
59431	59491	59418	59418	He	1656	" fumed Harry . I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons ! Why does n't he use another guinea pig for a change ? What 's Dumbledore playing at , anyway , letting him teach Defense ? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts ? He loves them ! All that unfixed , tndestructble stuff -- "
59494	59498	59418	59418	He	1656	" said Hermione , "
59508	59509	59501	59501	he	1656	" "
59513	59514	59511	59511	me	0	" "
59578	59605	59606	59606	Harry	136	" Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue . "
59612	59642	59610	59610	Harry	136	" Harry looked around ; Jack Sloper , one of the Beaters on last year 's Gryffindor Quidditch team , was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment . "
59646	59650	59610	59610	Harry	136	" panted Sloper . "
59667	59668	59669	59669	I	0	" "
59675	59694	59669	59669	I	0	" said Harry , thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team . "
59701	59702	59695	59695	I	0	" "
59716	59717	59707	59707	I	0	" "
59805	59811	59813	59813	Ron	217	" He enjoys Acid Pops ? "
59829	59843	59845	59845	Harry	136	" It 's the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study , "
59851	59875	59876	59876	He	136	" Ha ! Snape 's not going to be pleased . . . . I wo n't be able to do his detention ! "
60100	60103	60104	60104	Ernie	353	" Harry , "
60116	60166	60113	60113	Harry	136	" did n't get a chance to speak in Defense Against The Dark Arts this morning . Good lesson , I thought , but Shield Charms are old hat , of course , for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are you , Ron -- Hermione ? "
60173	60176	60168	60168	they	1672	" fine , "
60376	60386	60388	60388	Slughorn	216	" Now then , now then , now then , "
60401	60426	60388	60388	Slughorn	216	" Scales out , everyone , and potion kits , and do n't forget your copies of Advanced Potion - Making . . . . "
60427	60430	60432	60432	Harry	136	" Sir ? "
60438	60443	60432	60432	Harry	136	" Harry , m'boy ? "
60444	60476	60388	60388	Slughorn	216	" I have n't got a book or scales or anything - nor 's Ron - we did n't realize we 'd be able to do the N.E.W.T. , you see - "
60477	60551	60552	60552	Slughorn	216	" Ah , yes , Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry , my dear boy , not to worry at all . You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today , and I 'm sure we can lend you some scales , and we 've got a small stock of old books here , they 'll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts . . . . "
60599	60603	60605	60605	Slughorn	216	" Now then , "
60632	60698	60699	60699	He	216	" I 've prepared a few potions for you to have a look at , just out of interest , you know . These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s . You ought to have heard of 'em , even if you have n't made 'em yet . Anyone tell me what this one is ? "
60746	60766	60768	60768	Hermione	194	" It 's Veritaserum , a colorless , odorless potion thar forces the , drinker to tell the truth , "
60770	60777	60779	60779	Slughorn	216	" Very good , very good ! "
60782	60785	60786	60786	he	216	" Now , "
60798	60825	60786	60786	he	216	" this one here is pretty well known . . . . Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too . . . Who can - ? "
60834	60842	60843	60843	she	194	" lt 's Polyjuice Potion , sir , "
60895	60913	60915	60915	Slughorn	216	" Excellent , excellent ! Now , this one here . . . yes , my dear ? "
60931	60936	60923	60923	Hermione	194	" It 's Amortentia ! "
60937	60949	60951	60951	Slughorn	216	" It is indeed . Ir seems almost foolish to ask , "
60959	60969	60951	60951	Slughorn	216	" but I assume you know what it does ? "
60981	61006	60923	60923	Hermione	194	" said Hermione . ' Quire right ! You recognized it , I suppose , by its distinctive mother - of - pearl sheen ? "
61007	61016	61018	61018	Hermione	194	" And the steam rising in characteristic spirals , "
61021	61050	61018	61018	Hermione	194	" and it 's supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us , and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and - "
61073	61087	61052	61052	she	194	" said Slughorn , ignoring Hermione 's embarrassment . Hermione Granger , sir . "
61088	61113	61141	61141	Nott	315	" Granger ? Granger ? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth - Granger , who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers ? "
61114	61134	61135	61135	Harry	136	" No . I do n't think so , sir . I 'm Muggle - born , you see . "
61177	61216	61161	61161	he	216	" Oho ! ' One of my best friends is Muggle - born , and she 's the best in our year ! ' I 'm assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke , Harry ? "
61217	61222	61224	61224	Harry	136	" Yes , sir , "
61226	61243	61245	61245	Slughorn	216	" Well , well , take twenty well - earned points for Gryffindor , Miss Granger , "
61276	61294	61265	61265	Hermione	194	" Did you really tell him I 'm the best in the year ? Oh , Harry ! "
61295	61305	61307	61307	Ron	217	" Well , what 's so impressive about that ? "
61316	61337	61307	61307	Ron	217	" You are the best in the year - I 'd 've told him so if he 'd asked me ! "
61343	61345	61338	61338	Hermione	194	" shhing "
61363	61411	61412	61412	he	217	" Amortentia does n't really create love , of course . It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love . No , this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession . It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room - oh yes , "
61429	61452	61412	61412	he	217	" When you have seen as much of life as I have , you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love . ...
61453	61457	61459	61459	Slughorn	216	" And now , "
61461	61471	61459	61459	Slughorn	216	" it is time for us to start work . "
61472	61486	61488	61489	Ernie Macmillan	353	" Sir , you have n't told us what 's in this one , "
61537	61540	61542	61542	Slughorn	216	" Oho , "
61568	61596	61597	61597	he	217	" Yes . That . Well , that one , ladies and gentlemen , is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis . I take it , "
61615	61627	61605	61605	Hermione	358	" that you know what Felix Felicis does , Miss Granger ? "
61628	61634	61636	61636	Hermione	194	" It 's liquid luck , "
61639	61645	61636	61636	Hermione	194	" It makes you lucky ! "
61686	61709	61711	61711	Slughorn	216	" Quite right , take another ten points for Gryffindor . Yes , it 's a funny little potion , Felix Felicis , "
61713	61755	61711	61711	Slughorn	216	" Desperately tricky to make , and disastrous to get wrong . However , if brewed correctly , as this has been , you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed ... at least until the effects wear off . "
61756	61769	61771	61772	Terry Boot	359	" Why do n't people drink it all the time , sir ? "
61775	61792	61794	61794	Slughorn	216	" Because if taken in excess , it causes giddiness , recklessness , and dangerous overconfidence , "
61796	61825	61794	61794	Slughorn	216	" Too much of a good thing , you know . . . highly toxic in large quantities . But taken sparingly , and very occasionally . . . "
61826	61835	61837	61838	Michael Corner	275	" Have you ever taken it , sir ? "
61843	61849	61851	61851	Slughorn	216	" Twice in my life , "
61853	61880	61881	61881	He	170	" Once when I was twenty - four , once when I was fifty - seven . Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast . Two perfect days . "
61903	61907	61909	61909	Slughorn	216	" And that , "
61917	61931	61909	61909	Slughorn	216	" is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson . "
61949	61957	61959	61959	Slughorn	216	" One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis , "
61982	62004	61973	61973	his	216	" Enough for twelve hours ' luck . From dawn till dusk , you will be lucky in everything you attempt . "
62005	62061	61973	61973	his	216	" Now , I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions . . . sporting events , for instance , examinations , or elections . So the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary ! "
62062	62065	62067	62067	Slughorn	216	" So , "
62072	62164	62067	62067	Slughorn	216	" how are you to win fabulous prize ? Well , by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion Making . We have a little over an hour left to us , which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death . I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before , and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody . The person who does best , however , will win little Felix here . Off you go ! "
62390	62398	62374	62374	Hermione	358	" smooth , black currant - colored liquid "
62481	62494	62495	62495	Harry	136	" Sir , I think you knew my grandfather , Abraxas Malfoy ? "
62507	62510	62512	62512	Slughorn	216	" Yes , "
62519	62546	62548	62548	he	216	" I was sorry to hear he had died , although of course it was n't unexpected , dragon pox at his age . . . . "
62631	62639	62640	62640	She	358	" Can I borrow your silver knife ? "
62832	62839	62841	62841	Hermione	358	" How are you doing that ? "
62868	62874	62861	62861	her	358	" Add a clockwise stir - "
62875	62885	62886	62886	she	358	" No , no , the book says counterclockwise ! "
62976	62985	62987	62987	Slughorn	216	" And time 's . . . up ! "
62989	62995	62987	62987	Slughorn	216	" Stop stirring , please ! "
63087	63092	63093	63093	he	216	" The clear winner ! "
63099	63155	63093	63093	he	216	" Excellent , excellent , Harry ! Good lord , it 's clear you 've inherited your mother 's talent . She was a dab hand at Potions , Lily was ! Here you are , then , here you are - one bottle of Felix Felicis , as promised , and use it well ! "
63199	63206	63207	63207	he	217	" How did you do that ? "
63217	63224	63226	63226	Harry	136	" Got lucky , I suppose , "
63267	63275	63276	63276	he	136	" I s'pose you think I cheated ? "
63284	63298	63299	63299	she	358	" Well , it was n't exactly your own work , was it ? "
63303	63312	63314	63314	Ron	217	" He only followed different instructions to ours , "
63316	63337	63338	63338	He	217	" Could 've been a catastrophe , could n't it ? But he took a risk and it paid off . "
63343	63379	63338	63338	He	217	" Slughorn could 've handed me that book , but no , I get the one no one 's ever written on . Puked on , by the look of page fifty - two , but- "
63380	63384	63419	63419	Ginny	236	" Hang on , "
63424	63445	63419	63419	Ginny	236	" Did I hear right ? You 've been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book , Harry ? "
63462	63467	63468	63468	he	136	" It 's nothing , "
63476	63500	63468	63468	he	136	" It 's not like , you know , Riddle 's diary . It 's just an old textbook someone 's scribbled on . "
63501	63510	63473	63473	his	136	" But you 're doing what it says ? "
63511	63534	63473	63473	his	136	" I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins , honestly , Ginny , there 's nothing funny - "
63535	63542	63544	63544	Hermione	358	" Ginny 's got a point , "
63551	63575	63544	63544	Hermione	358	" We ought to check that there 's nothing odd about it . I mean , all these funny instructions , who knows ? "
63576	63579	63581	63581	Harry	136	" Hey ! "
63603	63607	63608	63608	she	236	" Specialis Revelio ! "
63638	63641	63643	63643	Harry	136	" Finished ? "
63646	63661	63643	63643	Harry	136	" Or d'you want to wait and see if it does a few backflips ? "
63662	63668	63670	63670	Hermione	358	" It seems all right , "
63679	63694	63670	63670	Hermione	358	" I mean , it really does seem to be ... just a textbook . "
63695	63705	63707	63707	Harry	136	" Good . Then I 'll have it back , "
63926	63928	63923	63923	she	358	" official "
64039	64043	64045	64045	Hermione	358	" Or herself , "
64067	64090	64049	64049	Harry	136	" It might have been a girl . I think the handwriting looks more like a girl 's than a boy 's . "
64091	64102	64103	64103	Harry	136	" The Half - Blood Prince , he was called , "
64106	64114	64103	64103	Harry	136	" How many girls have been Princes ? "
64170	64189	64149	64149	Harry	136	" It 's five to eight , I 'd better go , I 'll be late for Dumbledore . "
64190	64193	64195	64195	Hermione	358	" Ooooh ! "
64202	64220	64195	64195	Hermione	358	" Good luck ! We 'll wait up , we want to hear what he teaches you ! "
64221	64227	64229	64229	Ron	217	" Hope it goes okay , "
64288	64295	64296	64296	she	333	" Two of spades : conflict , "
64310	64343	64296	64296	she	333	" Seven of spades : an ill omen . Ten of spades : violence . Knave of spades : a dark young man , possibly troubled , one who dislikes the questioner — "
64358	64367	64368	64368	she	333	" Well , that ca n't be right , "
64431	64435	64437	64437	Harry	136	" Acid Pops , "
64494	64498	64500	64500	Dumbledore	146	" Come in , "
64504	64510	64512	64512	Harry	136	" Good evening , sir , "
64521	64532	64534	64534	Dumbledore	146	" Ah , good evening , Harry . Sit down , "
64540	64554	64534	64534	Dumbledore	146	" I hope you 've had an enjoyable first week back at school ? "
64555	64562	64564	64564	Harry	136	" Yes , thanks , sir , "
64566	64580	64564	64564	Harry	136	" You must have been busy , a detention under your belt already ! "
64581	64584	64586	64586	Harry	136	" Er , "
64597	64616	64590	64590	Dumbledore	146	" I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your de - tention next Saturday instead . "
64617	64620	64622	64622	Harry	136	" Right , "
64737	64742	64744	64744	Dumbledore	146	" So , Harry , "
64751	64781	64744	64744	Dumbledore	146	" You have been wondering , I am sure , what I have planned for you dur - ing these — for want of a better word — lessons ? "
64782	64787	64707	64707	his	365	" Yes , sir . "
64788	64824	64744	64744	Dumbledore	146	" Well , I have decided that it is time , now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago , for you to be given certain information . "
64830	64849	64851	64851	Harry	136	" You said , at the end of last term , you were going to tell me everything , "
64866	64869	64870	64870	he	136	" Sir , "
64873	64879	64881	64881	Dumbledore	146	" And so I did , "
64884	64953	64881	64881	Dumbledore	146	" I told you everything I know . From this point forth , we shall be leaving the firm founda - tion of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork . From here on in , Harry , I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher , who be - lieved the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron . "
64954	64962	64964	64964	Harry	136	" But you think you 're right ? "
64966	65014	64964	64964	Harry	136	" Naturally I do , but as I have already proven to you , I make mis - takes like the next man . In fact , being — forgive me — rather clev - erer than most men , my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger . "
65015	65018	65020	65020	Harry	136	" Sir , "
65023	65049	65020	65020	Harry	136	" does what you 're going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy ? Will it help me . . . survive ? "
65050	65063	65065	65067	Dumble - dore	367	" It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy , "
65083	65097	65073	65073	Harry	136	" and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive , . "
65166	65171	65154	65154	He	146	" You look worried . "
65234	65256	65230	65230	Dumbledore	146	" This time , you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and , even more unusually , with permission . "
65257	65265	65230	65230	Dumbledore	146	" Where are we going , sir ? "
65266	65277	65279	65279	Dumbledore	146	" For a trip down Bob Ogden 's memory lane , "
65296	65302	65283	65283	his	146	" Who was Bob Ogden ? "
65303	65317	65319	65319	Dumbledore	146	" He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforce - ment , "
65321	65373	65319	65319	Dumbledore	146	" He died some time ago , but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recol - lections to me . We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties . If you will stand , Harry ... "
65396	65404	65388	65388	His	146	" Shall — shall I , sir ? "
65405	65411	65412	65412	Dumbledore	146	" No matter , Harry — "
65425	65435	65412	65412	Dumbledore	146	" Sir — how did you injure your hand ? "
65455	65478	65479	65479	Dumbledore	146	" Now is not the moment for that story , Harry . Not yet . We have an appointment with Bob Ogden . "
65502	65506	65508	65508	Dumbledore	146	" After you , "
66367	66373	66374	66377	The man standing before	1773	" You 're not welcome . "
66446	66460	66443	66443	he	368	" Er — good morning . I 'm from the Ministry of Magic — "
66461	66467	66494	66495	the stranger	1775	" You 're not welcome . "
66468	66481	66483	66483	Ogden	368	" Er — I 'm sorry — I do n't understand you , "
66527	66538	66540	66540	Dumbledore	146	" You understand him , I 'm sure , Harry ? "
66543	66549	66551	66551	Harry	136	" Yes , of course , "
66556	66563	66551	66551	Harry	136	" Why ca n't Ogden — ? "
66583	66589	66577	66577	he	136	" He 's speaking Parseltongue ? "
66590	66594	66596	66596	Dumbledore	146	" Very good , "
66622	66627	66628	66628	Ogden	368	" Now , look — "
66662	66665	66671	66673	An elderly man	1777	" Morfin ! "
66771	66777	66779	66781	the older man	1781	" Ministry , is it ? "
66788	66791	66793	66793	Ogden	368	" Correct ! "
66800	66812	66793	66793	Ogden	368	" And you , I take it , are Mr. Gaunt ? "
66813	66816	66818	66818	Gaunt	369	" S'right , "
66820	66830	66818	66818	Gaunt	369	" Got you in the face , did he ? "
66831	66837	66839	66839	Ogden	368	" Yes , he did ! "
66841	66853	66855	66855	Gaunt	369	" Should 've made your presence known , should n't you ? "
66858	66879	66855	66855	Gaunt	369	" This is private property . Ca n't just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself . "
66880	66888	66890	66890	Ogden	368	" Defend himself against what , man ? "
66898	66907	66908	66908	Ogden	368	" Busybodies . Intruders . Muggles and filth . "
66950	66960	66937	66938	Mr. Gaunt	369	" Get in the house . Do n't argue . "
67045	67059	67064	67064	he	368	" It 's your son I 'm here to see , Mr. Gaunt , "
67078	67087	67064	67064	he	368	" That was Morfin , was n't it ? "
67088	67095	67097	67099	the old man	1784	" At , that was Morfin , "
67102	67109	67110	67110	he	1784	" Are you pure - blood ? "
67116	67124	67126	67126	Ogden	368	" That 's neither here nor there , "
67163	67183	67144	67144	He	369	" Now I come to think about it , I 've seen noses like yours down in the village . "
67184	67200	67202	67204	Og - den	372	" I do n't doubt it , if your sons been let loose on them , "
67206	67215	67202	67204	Og - den	372	" Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside ? "
67216	67219	67144	67144	He	369	" Inside ? "
67220	67243	67144	67144	He	369	" Yes , Mr. Gaunt . I 've already told you . I 'm here about Morfin . We sent an owl — "
67244	67252	67254	67254	Gaunt	369	" I 've no use for owls , "
67256	67263	67254	67254	Gaunt	369	" I do n't open letters . "
67264	67280	67282	67282	Ogden	368	" Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of vis - itors , "
67285	67308	67282	67282	Ogden	368	" I am here following a serious breach of Wizarding law , which occurred here in the early hours of this morning — "
67309	67319	67321	67321	Gaunt	369	" All right , all right , all right ! "
67323	67340	67321	67321	Gaunt	369	" Come in the bleeding house , then , and much good it 'll do you ! "
67552	67557	67559	67559	Gaunt	369	" M'daughter , Merope , "
67569	67573	67575	67575	Ogden	368	" Good morning , "
67607	67613	67615	67615	Ogden	368	" Well , Mr. Gaunt , "
67617	67647	67615	67615	Ogden	368	" to get straight to the point , we have reason to believe that your son , Morfin , performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night . "
67662	67667	67668	67668	Gaunt	369	" Pick it up ! "
67673	67699	67668	67668	Gaunt	369	" That 's it , grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle , what 's your wand for , you useless sack of muck ? "
67700	67706	67708	67708	Ogden	368	" Mr. Gaunt , please ! "
67794	67805	67791	67791	Gaunt	369	" Mend it , you pointless lump , mend it ! "
67831	67834	67822	67822	Ogden	368	" Reparo . "
67872	67907	67866	67866	he	369	" Lucky the nice man from the Ministry 's here , is n't it ? Perhaps he 'll take you off my hands , perhaps he does n't mind dirty Squibs . . . . "
67967	67971	67972	67972	Ogden	368	" Mr. Gaunt , "
67976	67988	67972	67972	Ogden	368	" as I 've said : the reason for my visit — "
67989	67997	67999	67999	Gaunt	369	" I heard you the first time ! "
68001	68025	67999	67999	Gaunt	369	" And so what ? Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him — what about it , then ? "
68026	68033	68035	68035	Ogden	368	" Morfin has broken Wizarding law , "
68038	68047	68048	68048	Gaunt	369	" ' Morfin has broken Wizarding law . ' "
68063	68080	68059	68059	Morfin	206	" He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson , that 's illegal now , is it ? "
68081	68084	68086	68086	Ogden	368	" Yes , "
68088	68095	68096	68096	He	368	" I 'm afraid it is . "
68111	68121	68123	68123	Gaunt	369	" What 's that , then , his sentence ? "
68130	68142	68125	68125	his	369	" It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing — "
68143	68160	68125	68125	his	369	" Summons ! Summons ? Who do you think you are , summoning my son anywhere ? "
68161	68172	68174	68174	Ogden	368	" I 'm Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad , "
68176	68187	68189	68189	Gaunt	369	" And you think we 're scum , do you ? "
68210	68240	68189	68189	Gaunt	369	" Scum who 'll come running when the Ministry tells 'em to ? Do you know who you 're talking to , you filthy little Mudblood , do you ? "
68241	68255	68257	68257	Ogden	368	" I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt , "
68267	68272	68274	68274	Gaunt	369	" That 's right ! "
68320	68383	68294	68294	he	369	" See this ? See this ? Know what it is ? Know where it came from ? Centuries it 's been in our family , that 's how far back we go , and pure - blood all the way ! Know how much I 've been offered for this , with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone ? "
68384	68391	68393	68393	Ogden	368	" I 've really no idea , "
68407	68424	68393	68393	Ogden	368	" and it 's quite beside the point , Mr. Gaunt . Your son has committed — "
68475	68479	68480	68480	he	136	" See this ? "
68501	68510	68512	68512	Ogden	368	" I see it , I see it ! "
68515	68518	68520	68520	Gaunt	369	" Slytherins ! "
68522	68545	68520	68520	Gaunt	369	" Salazar Slytherin 's ! We 're his last liv - ing descendants , what do you say to that , eh ? "
68546	68553	68555	68555	Ogden	368	" Mr. Gaunt , your daughter ! "
68585	68588	68590	68590	Gaunt	369	" So ! "
68607	68644	68595	68595	he	369	" Do n't you go talk - ing to us as if we 're dirt on your shoes ! Generations of purebloods , wizards all — more than you can say , I do n't doubt ! "
68681	68685	68687	68687	Ogden	368	" Mr. Gaunt , "
68690	68731	68733	68733	he	368	" I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand . I am here because of Morfin , Morfin and the Muggle he ac - costed late last night . Our information "
68742	68765	68733	68733	he	368	" is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle , causing him to erupt in highly painful hives . "
68769	68775	68777	68777	Gaunt	369	" Be quiet , boy , "
68787	68797	68798	68798	Gaunt	369	" And so what if he did , then ? "
68804	68825	68798	68798	Gaunt	369	" I expect you 've wiped the Muggle 's filthy face clean for him , and his memory to boot — "
68826	68839	68841	68841	Ogden	368	" That 's hardly the point , is it , Mr. Gaunt ? "
68843	68853	68841	68841	Ogden	368	" This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless — "
68854	68873	68875	68875	Gaunt	369	" Ar , I had you marked out as a Muggle - lover the moment I saw you , "
68885	68893	68895	68895	Ogden	368	" This discussion is getting us nowhere , "
68898	68918	68919	68919	He	368	" It is clear from your son 's attitude that he feels no remorse for his ac - tions . "
68929	68962	68963	68963	Ogden	368	" Morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg — "
69043	69051	69054	69055	a girl	4778	" My God , what an eyesore ! "
69081	69094	69070	69070	she	4778	" Could n't your father have that hovel cleared away , Tom ? "
69095	69101	69103	69105	a young man	1810	" It 's not ours , "
69109	69156	69103	69105	a young man	1810	" Everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us , but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt , and his children . The son 's quite mad , you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village — "
69182	69187	69189	69190	his father	904	" Keep your seat , "
69196	69199	69201	69202	the girl	1349	" Tom , "
69218	69234	69201	69202	the girl	1349	" I might be wrong — but has somebody nailed a snake to that door ? "
69235	69243	69245	69246	the man	874	" Good lord , you 're right ! "
69250	69289	69245	69246	the man	874	" That 'll be the son , I told you he 's not right in the head . Do n't look at it , Cecilia , darling . The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing faint again . "
69294	69305	69309	69309	he	874	" whispered Morfin in Parseltongue , looking at his sister . "
69321	69335	69309	69309	he	874	" Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint . "
69340	69357	69309	69309	he	874	" said Gaunt sharply , also in Parseltongue , looking from his son to his daughter . "
69365	69366	69360	69360	you	375	" "
69374	69396	69414	69414	she	1349	" said Morfin , a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister , who now looked terrified . "
69420	69435	69450	69450	she	1349	" Merope shook her head jerkily , imploringly , but Morfin went on ruthlessly , "
69452	69453	69450	69450	she	1349	" "
69465	69498	69450	69450	she	1349	" said Gaunt quietly . All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden , who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping . "
69503	69521	69450	69450	she	1349	" said Gaunt in a deadly voice , advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl . "
69543	69561	69522	69523	My daughter	1820	" Merope shook her head frantically , pressing herself into the wall , apparently unable to speak . "
69569	69573	69574	69574	I	0	" cackled Morfin . "
69599	69600	69595	69595	he	1817	" "
69612	69634	69601	69601	You	361	" roared Gaunt , losing control , and his hands closed around his daughter 's throat . Both Harry and Ogden yelled "
69637	69650	69601	69601	You	361	" at the same time ; Ogden raised his wand and cried , "
69653	69823	69830	69830	Harry	136	" Gaunt was thrown backward , away from his daughter ; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back . With a roar of rage , Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden , brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand . Ogden ran for his life . Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed , Merope 's screams echoing in his ears . Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane , his arms over his head , where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome , dark - haired young man . Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden , who bounced off the horse 's flank and set off again , his frock coat flying , covered from head to foot in dust , running pell - mell up the lane . "
69832	69872	69830	69830	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore . He took Harry by the elbow and tugged . Next moment , they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness , until they landed squarely on their feet , back in Dumbledore 's now twilit office . "
69882	69900	69901	69901	Merope	361	" said Harry at once , as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand . "
69909	69910	69901	69901	Merope	361	" "
69916	69934	69935	69935	Ogden	368	" said Dumbledore , reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too . "
70011	70012	70013	70013	Marvolo	378	" "
70015	70020	70013	70013	Marvolo	378	" Harry repeated wonderingly . "
70025	70033	70034	70034	I	0	" said Dumbledore , smiling in approval . "
70044	70045	70046	70048	That old man	1833	" "
70052	70053	70046	70048	That old man	1833	" "
70060	70064	70065	70065	Marvolo	378	" said Dumbledore . "
70189	70190	70173	70173	he	378	" "
70194	70210	70192	70192	Merope	361	" said Harry , leaning forward in his chair and star - ing at Dumbledore , "
70231	70232	70222	70222	she	361	" "
70236	70240	70222	70222	she	361	" said Dumbledore . "
70262	70263	70259	70259	you	1841	" "
70275	70276	70269	70273	The man on the horse	1848	" "
70281	70287	70269	70273	The man on the horse	1848	" said Dumbledore , beaming . "
70320	70321	70311	70312	Merope Gaunt	361	" "
70328	70346	70347	70347	I	0	" Harry said in disbelief , unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love . "
70353	70357	70349	70349	you	1841	" said Dumbledore , "
70441	70442	70415	70415	she	361	" "
70471	70472	70444	70444	you	1841	" "
70477	70481	70444	70444	you	1841	" Harry suggested . "
70487	70488	70444	70444	you	1841	" "
70598	70599	70596	70596	Merope	361	" "
70655	70656	70651	70651	she	1800	" "
70724	70725	70718	70718	Morfin	206	" "
70748	70749	70741	70741	Voldemort	192	" "
70754	70758	70741	70741	Voldemort	192	" said Dumbledore . "
70913	70914	70905	70905	he	379	" "
70922	70923	70905	70905	he	379	" "
70944	70945	70934	70935	Tom Riddle	379	" "
70950	70954	70934	70935	Tom Riddle	379	" asked Harry . "
70963	70964	70934	70935	Tom Riddle	379	" "
70971	70975	70934	70935	Tom Riddle	379	" said Dumbledore , "
71083	71105	71106	71106	I	0	" The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore 's office seemed to glow more brightly than before . "
71116	71125	71114	71114	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore after a moment or two . "
71130	71145	71146	71146	Sir	985	" said Harry . He got to his feet , but did not leave . "
71160	71161	71165	71165	I	0	" "
71168	71172	71165	71165	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
71186	71187	71165	71165	I	0	" "
71197	71198	71165	71165	I	0	" "
71201	71233	71234	71234	Sir	985	" said Harry , a little confused , but reassured all the same . He turned to go , then another question occurred to him , and he turned back again . "
71250	71261	71245	71245	you	985	" Dumbledore considered him for a moment , then said , "
71325	71326	71320	71321	Lord Voldemort	192	" "
71345	71397	71398	71398	Sir	985	" He turned away again , and was almost at the door when he saw it . Sitting on one of the little spindle - legged tables that supported so many frail - looking silver instruments , was an ugly gold ring set with a large , cracked , black stone . "
71400	71408	71398	71398	Sir	985	" said Harry , staring at it . "
71412	71413	71398	71398	Sir	985	" "
71416	71420	71398	71398	Sir	985	" said Dumbledore . "
71433	71434	71421	71421	You	136	" "
71439	71443	71436	71436	I	0	" Dumbledore agreed . "
71462	71468	71457	71458	Marvolo Gaunt	378	" Dumbledore bowed his head . "
71473	71474	71457	71458	Marvolo Gaunt	378	" "
71486	71487	71481	71481	you	136	" "
71496	71500	71490	71490	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
71520	71521	71505	71505	I	0	" "
71537	71538	71535	71535	sir	985	" "
71547	71555	71556	71556	Sir	985	" Harry hesitated . Dumbledore was smiling . "
71562	71563	71556	71556	Sir	985	" "
71580	71581	71585	71585	sir	985	" "
71587	71587	71585	71585	sir	985	"
71921	71930	71932	71932	Hermione	194	" We 've got to go and explain , "
71952	71961	71963	71963	Ron	217	" We 've got Quidditch tryouts this morning ! "
71965	71997	71963	71963	Ron	217	" And we 're supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick ! Anyway , explain what ? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject ? "
71998	72005	72007	72007	Hermione	194	" We did n't hate it ! "
72009	72021	72023	72023	Ron	217	" Speak for yourself , I have n't forgotten the skrewts , "
72026	72069	72023	72023	Ron	217	" And I 'm telling you now , we 've had a narrow escape . You did n't hear him going on about his gormless brother — we 'd have been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we 'd stayed . "
72070	72078	72080	72080	Hermione	194	" I hate not talking to Hagrid , "
72085	72093	72094	72094	Harry	136	" We 'll go down after Quidditch , "
72122	72138	72139	72139	He	136	" But trials might take all morning , the number of people who have applied . "
72152	72166	72139	72139	He	136	" I dunno why the team 's this popular all of a sudden . "
72167	72175	72177	72177	Hermione	194	" Oh , come on , Harry , "
72182	72214	72177	72177	Hermione	194	" It 's not Quidditch that 's popular , it 's you ! You 've never been more in - teresting , and frankly , you 've never been more fanciable . "
72237	72314	72315	72315	Harry	136	" Everyone knows you 've been telling the truth now , do n't they ? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times . And now they 're calling you ' the Chosen One ' — well , come on , ca n't you see why people are fascinated by you ? "
72338	72397	72446	72446	Hermione	194	" And you 've been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar . You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood , but you stuck to your story anyway . ... "
72398	72418	72420	72420	Ron	217	" You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Min - istry , look , "
72427	72445	72446	72446	Hermione	194	" And it does n't hurt that you 've grown about a foot over the summer either , "
72452	72457	72459	72459	Ron	217	" I 'm tall , "
72610	72613	72615	72615	Harry	136	" Ha ! "
72637	72641	72643	72643	Hermione	194	" Oh good , "
72647	72657	72643	72643	Hermione	194	" Now you can give that graffitied copy back . "
72658	72663	72665	72665	Harry	136	" Are you mad ? "
72667	72681	72682	72682	He	136	" I 'm keeping it ! Look , I 've thought it out — "
72706	72709	72701	72701	his	136	" Dijjindo ! "
72744	72747	72732	72732	He	136	" Reparo ! "
72776	72796	72797	72797	Hermione	194	" I 'll give Slughorn back the new one , he ca n't complain , it cost nine Galleons . "
72842	72848	72850	72850	Ron	217	" Anyone we know dead ? "
72869	72880	72882	72882	Hermi	384	" No , but there have been more dementor attacks , "
72886	72891	72882	72882	Hermi	384	" And an arrest . "
72892	72897	72899	72899	Harry	136	" Excellent , who ? "
72906	72910	72912	72912	Hermione	194	" Stan Shunpike , "
72914	72917	72919	72919	Harry	136	" What ? "
72923	72973	72919	72919	Harry	136	" ' Stanley Shunpike , conductor on the popular Wizarding con - veyance the Knight Bus , has been arrested on suspicion of Death Eater activity . Mr. Shunpike , 21 , was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home . . . ' "
72974	72982	72984	72984	Harry	136	" Stan Shunpike , a Death Eater ? "
72998	73002	72984	72984	Harry	136	" No way ! "
73003	73014	73016	73016	Ron	217	" He might have been put under the Imperius Curse , "
73019	73025	73016	73016	Ron	217	" You never can tell . "
73026	73034	73036	73036	Hermione	194	" It does n't look like it , "
73043	73066	73067	73067	She	194	" It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters ' secret plans in a pub . "
73078	73100	73067	73067	She	194	" If he was under the Imperius Curse , he 'd hardly stand around gossiping about their plans , would he ? "
73101	73118	73120	73120	Ron	217	" It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did , "
73122	73150	73120	73120	Ron	217	" Is n't he the one who claimed he was going to be - come Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela ? "
73151	73158	73160	73160	Harry	136	" Yeah , that 's him , "
73162	73175	73160	73160	Harry	136	" I dunno what they 're playing at , taking Stan seriously . "
73176	73191	73193	73193	Hermione	194	" They probably want to look as though they 're doing some - thing , "
73197	73231	73193	73193	Hermione	194	" People are terrified — you know the Patil twins ' parents want them to go home ? And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn . Her father picked her up last night . "
73232	73235	73237	73237	Ron	217	" What ! "
73243	73274	73237	73237	Ron	217	" But Hogwarts is safer than their homes , bound to be ! We 've got Aurors , and all those extra protective spells , and we 've got Dumbledore ! "
73275	73288	73290	73290	Hermione	194	" I do n't think we 've got him all the time , "
73306	73326	73327	73327	Harry	136	" Have n't you noticed ? His seat 's been empty as often as Hagrid 's this past week . "
73366	73381	73383	73383	Hermione	194	" I think he 's left the school to do something with the Order , "
73389	73405	73383	73383	Hermione	194	" I mean . . . it 's all looking serious , is n't it ? "
73703	73716	73717	73717	he	1922	" We met on the train , in old Sluggy 's compartment , "
73732	73738	73717	73717	he	1922	" Cormac McLaggen , Keeper . "
73739	73751	73753	73753	Harry	136	" You did n't try out last year , did you ? "
73777	73790	73792	73792	McLaggen	302	" I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials , "
73800	73811	73792	73792	McLaggen	302	" Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet . "
73812	73815	73817	73817	Harry	136	" Right , "
73819	73830	73831	73831	He	136	" Well . . . if you wait over there ... "
73876	73880	73866	73866	McLaggen	302	" old Sluggy 's "
74063	74076	74078	74078	Harry	136	" If there 's anyone else here who 's not from Gryffindor , "
74088	74221	74078	74078	Harry	136	" leave now , please ! There was a pause , then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch , snorting with laughter . After two hours , many complaints , and several tantrums , one in - volving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth , Harry had found himself three Chasers : Katie Bell , returned to the team after an excellent trial ; a new find called Demelza Robins , who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers ; and Ginny Weasley , who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot . Pleased though he was with his choices , Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters . "
74245	74538	74240	74240	I	0	" he bellowed . Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George , but he was still reasonably pleased with them : Jimmy Peakes , a short but broad - chested third - year boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry 's head with a ferociously hit Bludger , and Ritchie Coote , who looked weedy but aimed well . They now joined Katie , Demelza , and Ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member . Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last , hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned . Unfortunately , however , all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now , so that it was larger than ever . As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops , the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure . Harry glanced over at Ron , who had always had a problem with nerves ; Harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it , but apparently not : Ron was a delicate shade of green . None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece . To Harry 's great disappointment , Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five . On the last one , however , he shot off in completely the wrong direction ; the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth . Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven . "
74542	74681	74682	74683	His sister	5340	" cried a voice from the stands . Harry looked around , expecting to see Hermione , but it was Lavender Brown . He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands , as she did a moment later , but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit , and so turned to watch Ron do his trial . Yet he need not have worried : Ron saved one , two , three , four , five penalties in a row . Delighted , and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty , Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that , most unfortunately , Ron had beaten him , only to find McLaggen 's red face inches from his own . He stepped back hastily . "
74689	74716	74717	74717	She	5340	" said McLaggen menacingly . There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often ad - mired in Uncle Vernon 's . "
74724	74725	74717	74717	She	5340	" "
74728	74733	74717	74717	She	5340	" said Harry coldly . "
74742	74757	74717	74717	She	5340	" McLaggen took a step nearer Harry , who stood his ground this time . "
74763	74764	74717	74717	She	5340	" "
74767	74771	74772	74772	You	1943	" said Harry . "
74803	74848	74800	74800	my	0	" He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him , but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away , growling what sounded like threats to thin air . Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him . "
74852	74856	74857	74857	You	1943	" he croaked . "
74862	74863	74864	74864	You	1943	" "
74870	75002	74868	74868	Ron	217	" This time it really was Hermione running toward them from the stands ; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch , arm in arm with Parvati , a rather grumpy expression on her face . Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione . After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday , Harry , Ron , and Hermione bade good - bye to the rest of the team and headed off toward Hagrid 's . A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last . Harry felt extremely hungry ; he hoped there would be some - thing to eat at Hagrid 's . "
75014	75022	75005	75005	I	0	" Ron was say - ing happily . "
75040	75041	75029	75029	you	0	" "
75050	75057	75046	75046	you	0	" said Hermione , looking amused . "
75066	75075	75063	75063	McLaggen	302	" said Ron in a highly satisfied voice . "
75100	75170	75094	75094	he	302	" To Harry 's surprise , Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words . Ron noticed nothing ; he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail . The great gray hippogriff , Buckbeak , was tethered in front of Hagrid 's cabin . He clicked his razor - sharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them . "
75174	75179	75094	75094	he	302	" said Hermione nervously . "
75191	75192	75189	75189	he	302	" "
75206	75238	75204	75204	you	1946	" said Ron . Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking . After a few seconds , Buckbeak sank into a bow too . "
75243	75262	75241	75241	you	1946	" Harry asked him in a low voice , moving for - ward to stroke the feathery head . "
75278	75279	75276	75276	you	1946	" "
75282	75330	75276	75276	you	1946	" said a loud voice . Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes . His enormous boarhound , Fang , was at his heels ; Fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward . "
75349	75391	75276	75276	you	1946	" Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron , attempting to lick their ears . Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second , then turned and strode into his cabin , slamming the door behind him . "
75395	75402	75276	75276	you	1946	" said Hermione , looking stricken . "
75409	75424	75425	75425	Hagrid	218	" said Harry grimly . He walked over to the door and knocked loudly . "
75437	75445	75430	75430	we	1947	" There was no sound from within . "
75460	75469	75470	75470	Harry	136	" Harry said , pulling out his wand . "
75472	75479	75480	75480	You	136	" said Hermione , sounding shocked . "
75487	75488	75480	75480	You	136	" "
75494	75498	75480	75480	You	136	" said Harry . "
75502	75543	75480	75480	You	136	" But before he could say anything else , the door flew open again as Harry had known it would , and there stood Hagrid , glowering down at him and looking , despite the flowery apron , positively alarming . "
75549	75555	75556	75557	A teacher	4686	" he roared at Harry . "
75571	75572	75563	75563	yeh	1950	" "
75578	75599	75577	75577	sir	985	" said Harry , emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes . Hagrid looked stunned . "
75610	75611	75603	75603	yeh	1950	" "
75622	75623	75615	75615	you	1950	" "
75629	75633	75615	75615	you	1950	" growled Hagrid . "
75659	75681	75653	75653	yeh	1950	" Mumbling darkly , he stood back to let them pass . Hermione scurried in after Harry , looking rather frightened . "
75684	75722	75653	75653	yeh	1950	" said Hagrid grumpily , as Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table , Fang laying his head im - mediately upon Harry 's knee and drooling all over his robes . "
75740	75741	75774	75774	yeh	1954	" "
75744	75750	75774	75774	yeh	1954	" said Harry at once . "
75757	75758	75751	75751	We	1953	" "
75764	75769	75774	75774	yeh	1954	" said Hermione tremulously . "
75776	75780	75774	75774	yeh	1954	" snorted Hagrid . "
75786	75847	75783	75783	Righ	399	" He stomped around , brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle , muttering all the while . Finally he slammed down three bucket - sized mugs of mahogany - brown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes . Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid 's cooking , and took one at once . "
75850	75885	75783	75783	Righ	399	" said Hermione timidly , when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that sug - gested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong , "
75901	75932	75933	75933	We	1955	" Hagrid gave another great snort . Harry rather thought some bo - geys landed on the potatoes , and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner . "
75936	75940	75933	75933	We	1955	" said Hermione . "
75952	75953	75956	75956	Righ	399	" "
75959	76030	75956	75956	Righ	399	" said Hagrid again . There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around : Hermione let out a tiny shriek , and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed . It was full of what looked like foot - long maggots , slimy , white , and writhing . "
76037	76059	76035	76035	Hagrid	218	" asked Harry , trying to sound interested rather than revolted , but putting down his rock cake all the same . "
76065	76069	76035	76035	Hagrid	218	" said Hagrid . "
76076	76083	76084	76084	They	1957	" said Ron , looking apprehensive . "
76091	76095	76096	76096	I	0	" said Hagrid . "
76104	76114	76115	76115	Hagrid	218	" And without warning , he burst into tears . "
76117	76147	76115	76115	Hagrid	218	" cried Hermione , leaping up , hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots , and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders . "
76152	76153	76154	76154	It	1958	" "
76162	76183	76154	76154	It	1958	" gulped Hagrid , his beetle - black eyes stream - ing as he mopped his face with his apron . "
76239	76343	76231	76231	We	1959	" Hermione patted Hagrid 's shoulder , looking at a complete loss for anything to say . Harry knew how she felt . He had known Ha - grid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear , seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers , attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a half - brother , but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies : the gigantic talking spider , Aragog , who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously . "
76354	76370	76371	76371	I	0	" Hermione asked , ig - noring Ron 's frantic grimaces and head - shakings . "
76380	76393	76371	76371	I	0	" choked Hagrid , attempting to stem the flood of his tears . "
76424	76425	76409	76409	they	1960	" "
76440	76447	76428	76428	I	0	" said Ron in an undertone . "
76471	76486	76449	76449	I	0	" Hagrid finished , blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up . "
76503	76560	76563	76563	I	0	" After that , the atmosphere lightened considerably , for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous , gargantuan spider , Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and be - came his usual self once more . "
76577	76587	76574	76574	yer	1965	" he said gruffly , pouring them more tea . "
76597	76598	76590	76590	yeh	1965	" "
76605	76609	76610	76610	We	1965	" said Hermione . "
76638	76639	76668	76668	yeh	1965	" "
76645	76649	76668	76668	yeh	1965	" said Hagrid . "
76697	76749	76687	76690	Professor Grubbly - Plank	405	" At which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor Grubbly - Plank , who had substituted for Hagrid a few times , was a dreadful teacher , with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk , he looked quite cheerful . "
76754	76796	76750	76750	I	0	" said Harry , once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds ; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous crack - ing noise from one of his back teeth . "
76817	76880	76750	76750	I	0	" As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen en - tering the Great Hall . It took him two attempts to get through the doors ; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt . Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him , but Harry caught Hermione 's arm and held her back . "
76883	76888	76750	76750	I	0	" said Hermione defensively . "
76894	76899	76903	76903	he	302	" said Harry quietly , "
76922	76926	76910	76910	he	302	" Hermione blushed . "
76937	76941	76933	76933	I	0	" she whispered . "
76992	76993	76980	76980	you	1967	" "
76996	77000	76980	76980	you	1967	" said Harry . "
77031	77032	77029	77029	you	1967	" "
77038	77046	77029	77029	you	1967	" she snapped , as he smirked . "
77053	77069	77049	77049	you	1970	" demanded Ron , reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious . "
77072	77122	77123	77123	Harry	136	" said Harry and Hermione together , and they hurried after Ron . The smell of roast beef made Harry 's stomach ache with hunger , but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffindor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them , blocking their path . "
77136	77157	77125	77125	Harry	136	" he boomed ge - nially , twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly , "
77249	77280	77281	77281	I	0	" Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking . It was as though Ron was not present ; Slughorn did not so much as look at him . "
77288	77294	77281	77281	I	0	" said Harry at once . "
77306	77307	77303	77304	Professor Snape	221	" "
77311	77320	77303	77304	Professor Snape	221	" said Slughorn , his face falling comically . "
77378	77387	77388	77388	He	156	" He bustled away out of the Hall . "
77397	77411	77388	77388	He	156	" said Harry , the mo - ment Slughorn was out of earshot . "
77435	77436	77426	77426	he	221	" "
77455	77469	77426	77426	he	221	" said Hermione anxiously ; Harry knew that she was thinking about McLaggen . "
77482	77584	77477	77477	Ginny'll	407	" snapped Ron , who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn . After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower . The common room was very crowded , as most people had finished dinner by now , but they managed to find a free table and sat down ; Ron , who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn , folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling . Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet , which somebody had left abandoned on a chair . "
77588	77592	77477	77477	Ginny'll	407	" said Harry . "
77598	77611	77477	77477	Ginny'll	407	" Hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages . "
77629	77642	77646	77646	he	4814	" she added quickly , for Ron had looked around in alarm . "
77710	77711	77714	77714	mine	1983	" "
77716	77720	77721	77721	I	0	" said Harry . "
77763	77764	77768	77768	he	222	" "
77774	77787	77772	77772	Harry	136	" said Hermione , putting down the newspaper with a surprised look . "
77800	77801	77803	77803	you	1986	" "
77805	77812	77803	77803	you	1986	" said Harry , taken aback . "
77817	77818	77813	77813	I	0	" "
77888	77913	77914	77914	Someone	5066	" Momentarily stymied , Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection . "
77925	77929	77914	77914	Someone	5066	" he said . "
77935	77936	77933	77933	someone	5066	" "
77945	77949	77950	77950	Filch	327	" said Hermione . "
77966	78020	77955	77955	he	327	" Really stumped this time , Harry found nothing else to say . There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into the school . He looked hopefully at Ron , who was sitting with his arms folded , staring over at Lavender Brown . "
78030	78031	78027	78027	Malfoy	170	" "
78039	78043	78037	78037	Harry	136	" said Ron . "
78071	78078	78068	78068	you	1991	" said Harry , firing up . "
78090	78100	78101	78101	I	0	" said Ron , getting to his feet again , "
78109	78132	78133	78133	Harry	136	" He stomped off toward the door to the boys ' dormitories , leav - ing Harry and Hermione staring after him . "
78135	78150	78133	78133	Harry	136	" said the new Chaser , Demelza Robins , appearing suddenly at his shoulder . "
78159	78160	78151	78151	I	0	" "
78165	78173	78162	78163	Professor Slughorn	216	" asked Harry , sitting up hopefully . "
78181	78190	78178	78179	Professor Snape	221	" said Demelza . Harry 's heart sank . "
78259	78260	78248	78248	he	221	" "
78263	78268	78248	78248	he	221	" said Harry grimly . "
78275	78275	78273	78273	Demelza	392	"
78841	78844	78845	78845	Harry	136	" nonverbal . "
78922	78925	78908	78908	he	136	" Aaaaaaaargh ! "
78982	78985	78987	78987	Harry	136	" Sorry ! "
79012	79022	79023	79023	He	136	" Hang on — I 'll let you down — "
79093	79096	79098	79098	Harry	136	" Sorry , "
79111	79114	79116	79116	Ron	217	" Tomorrow , "
79122	79132	79116	79116	Ron	217	" I 'd rather you set the alarm clock . "
79205	79224	79225	79225	Ron	217	" ... and then there was another flash , of light and I landed on the bed again ! "
79254	79272	79273	79273	she	194	" Was this spell , by any chance , another one from that potion book of yours ? "
79281	79293	79276	79276	Harry	136	" Always jump to the worst conclusion , do n't you ? "
79294	79298	79233	79233	Hermione	194	" Was it ? "
79299	79313	79276	79276	Harry	136	" Well . . . yeah , it was , but so what ? "
79314	79335	79276	79276	Harry	136	" So you just decided to try out an unknown , handwritten in - cantation and see what would happen ? "
79336	79346	79348	79348	Harry	136	" Why does it matter if it 's handwritten ? "
79360	79370	79372	79372	Hermione	194	" Because its probably not Ministry of Magic approved , "
79374	79378	79379	79379	she	194	" And also , "
79390	79405	79379	79379	she	194	" because I 'm starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy . "
79416	79422	79424	79424	Ron	217	" It was a laugh ! "
79434	79445	79424	79424	Ron	217	" Just a laugh , Hermione , that 's all ! "
79446	79455	79457	79459	Hermi - one	1925	" Dangling people upside down by the ankle ? "
79461	79475	79457	79459	Hermi - one	1925	" Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that ? "
79476	79481	79483	79483	Ron	217	" Fred and George , "
79487	79499	79483	79483	Ron	217	" it 's their kind of thing . And , er — "
79500	79504	79506	79506	Harry	136	" My dad , "
79514	79517	79519	79519	Ron	217	" What ? "
79524	79531	79533	79533	Harry	136	" My dad used this spell , "
79535	79542	79533	79533	Harry	136	" I — Lupin told me . "
79604	79614	79616	79616	Hermione	194	" Maybe your dad did use it , Harry , "
79618	79659	79616	79616	Hermione	194	" but he 's not the only one . We 've seen a whole bunch of people use it , in case you 've forgotten . Dangling people in the air . Making them float along , asleep , helpless . "
79691	79696	79697	79697	he	217	" That was different , "
79701	79726	79727	79727	he	217	" They were abusing it . Harry and his dad were just having a laugh . You do n't like the Prince , Hermione , "
79737	79747	79727	79727	he	217	" because he 's better than you at Potions — "
79748	79758	79760	79760	Hermione	194	" It 's got nothing to do with that ! "
79766	79829	79760	79760	Hermione	194	" I just think it 's very irresponsible to start performing spells when you do n't even know what they 're for , and stop talking about ' the Prince ' as if it 's his title , I bet it 's just a stupid nickname , and it does n't seem as though he was a very nice person to me ! "
79830	79841	79843	79843	Harry	136	" I do n't see where you get that from , "
79846	79872	79843	79843	Harry	136	" If he 'd been a budding Death Eater he would n't have been boasting about being ' half - blood , ' would he ? "
79910	79932	79934	79934	Hermione	194	" The Death Eaters ca n't all be pure - blood , there are n't enough pure - blood wizards left , "
79937	79974	79934	79934	Hermione	194	" I expect most of them are half - bloods pretending to be pure . It 's only Muggle - borns they hate , they 'd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up . "
79975	79989	79991	79991	Ron	217	" There is no way they 'd let me be a Death Eater ! "
80020	80040	80014	80015	Ernie Macmillan	353	" My whole family are blood traitors ! That 's as bad as Muggle - borns to Death Eaters ! "
80041	80050	80052	80052	Harry	136	" And they 'd love to have me , "
80055	80072	80052	80052	Harry	136	" We 'd be best pals if they did n't keep trying to do me in . "
80095	80108	80093	80093	Ginny	236	" Hey , Harry , I 'm supposed to give you this . "
80129	80143	80144	80144	Harry	136	" Thanks , Ginny . . . It 's Dumbledore 's next lesson ! "
80162	80166	80167	80167	He	217	" Monday evening ! "
80174	80184	80185	80185	he	217	" Want to join us in Hogsmeade , Ginny ? "
80188	80200	80201	80201	she	194	" I 'm going with Dean — might see you there , "
80257	80270	80274	80274	Ron	217	" What does it matter if we 're smuggling Dark stuff OUT ? "
80287	80300	80274	80274	Ron	217	" Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN ? "
80454	80458	80460	80460	Ron	217	" Thank God , "
80473	80481	80460	80460	Ron	217	" Let 's stay here all afternoon . "
80482	80487	80460	80460	Ron	217	" Harry , m'boy ! "
80496	80500	80502	80502	Harry	136	" Oh no , "
80549	80564	80566	80566	Slughorn	216	" Harry , that 's three of my little suppers you 've missed now ! "
80575	80599	80566	80566	Slughorn	216	" It wo n't do , m'boy , I 'm determined to have you ! Miss Granger loves them , do n't you ? "
80600	80603	80605	80605	Hermione	194	" Yes , "
80608	80613	80605	80605	Hermione	194	" they 're really — "
80614	80625	80627	80627	Slughorn	216	" So why do n't you come along , Harry ? "
80629	80640	80642	80642	Harry	136	" Well , I 've had Quidditch practice , Professor , "
80693	80712	80714	80714	Slughorn	216	" Well , I certainly expect you to win your first match after all the , hard work ! "
80716	80744	80714	80714	Slughorn	216	" But a little recreation never hurt any body . Now , how about Monday night , you ca n't possibly want to practice in this weather .... "
80745	80768	80801	80801	he	136	" I ca n't , Professor , I 've got — er — an appointment with Profes - sor Dumbledore that evening . "
80769	80773	80775	80775	Slughorn	216	" Unlucky again ! "
80778	80794	80775	80775	Slughorn	216	" Ah , well . . . you ca n't evade me forever , Harry ! "
80827	80840	80842	80842	Hermione	194	" I ca n't believe you 've wriggled out of another one , "
80848	80870	80842	80842	Hermione	194	" They 're not that bad , you know . . . They 're even quite fun sometimes . . . . "
80881	80898	80877	80877	Ron	217	" Oh , look — they 've got deluxe sugar quills — those would last hours ! "
80947	80956	80958	80958	Harry	136	" Let 's go to the Three Broomsticks , "
80960	80966	80958	80958	Harry	136	" It 'll be warm . "
81115	81118	81108	81108	Harry	136	" Mundungus ! "
81159	81168	81170	81171	Mundungus Fletcher	410	" Oh , ' ello , ' Arry , "
81183	81193	81195	81195	he	2041	" Well , do n't let me keep ya . "
81219	81226	81228	81228	Harry	136	" Are you selling this stuff ? "
81244	81255	81257	81257	Mundungus	410	" Oh , well , got ta scrape a living , "
81259	81263	81257	81257	Mundungus	410	" Gimme that ! "
81274	81278	81279	81279	Ron	217	" Hang on , "
81283	81288	81279	81279	Ron	217	" This looks familiar — "
81289	81293	81295	81295	Mundungus	410	" Thank you ! "
81313	81324	81325	81325	Harry	136	" Well , I 'll see you all _ OUCH ! "
81352	81355	81357	81357	Hermione	194	" Harry ! "
81359	81368	81370	81370	Harry	136	" You rook that from Sinus 's house , "
81393	81403	81370	81370	Harry	136	" That had the Black family crest on it . "
81404	81412	81414	81414	Mundungus	410	" I — no — what — ? "
81422	81439	81441	81441	Harry	136	" What did you do , go back the night he died and strip the place ? "
81443	81448	81441	81441	Harry	136	" I — no — "
81449	81455	81465	81465	Hermione	194	" Give it to me ! "
81456	81463	81465	81465	Hermione	194	" Harry , you must n't ! "
81527	81535	81507	81507	Harry	136	" COME BACK , YOU THIEVING — ! "
81536	81544	81545	81545	Tonks	226	" There 's no point , Harry . "
81559	81575	81545	81545	Tonks	226	" Mundungus will probably be in London by now . There 's no point yelling . "
81576	81587	81507	81507	Harry	136	" He 's nicked Sirius 's stuff ! Nicked it ! "
81588	81594	81596	81596	Tonks	226	" Yes , but still , "
81608	81617	81596	81596	Tonks	226	" You should get out of the cold . "
81642	81650	81638	81638	Harry	136	" He was nicking Sirius 's stuff ! "
81651	81667	81671	81671	Hermione	194	" I know , Harry , but please do n't shout , people are staring , "
81673	81686	81671	81671	Hermione	194	" Go and sit down , I 'll get you a drink . "
81707	81715	81716	81716	Harry	136	" Ca n't the Order control Mundungus ? "
81727	81750	81716	81716	Harry	136	" Ca n't they at least stop him steal - ing everything that 's not fixed down when he 's at headquarters ? "
81751	81754	81756	81756	Hermione	194	" Shh ! "
81797	81816	81787	81787	Zabini	301	" Harry , I 'd be annoyed too , I know it 's your things he 's stealing — "
81836	81844	81845	81845	he	136	" Yeah , it 's my stuff ! "
81848	81881	81845	81845	he	136	" No wonder he was n't pleased to see me ! Well , I 'm going to tell Dumbledore what 's going on , he 's the only one who scares Mundungus . "
81882	81886	81888	81888	Hermione	194	" Good idea , "
81898	81907	81845	81845	he	136	" Ron , what are you staring at ? "
81908	81911	81913	81913	Ron	217	" Nothing , "
81954	81968	81970	81970	Hermione	194	" I expect ' nothing 's ' in the back getting more firewhisky , "
82040	82055	82037	82037	she	194	" Shall we call it a day and go back to school , then ? "
82241	82252	82255	82255	Katie	153	" It 's nothing to do with you , Leanne ! "
82547	82551	82552	82552	he	136	" Stay there ! "
82562	82569	82552	82552	he	136	" I 'm going for help ! "
82621	82624	82625	82625	he	136	" Hagrid ! "
82639	82642	82644	82644	Hagrid	218	" Harry ! "
82666	82685	82659	82659	his	136	" Jus ' bin visitin ' Grawp , he 's comin ' on so well yeh wouldn ' — "
82686	82701	82707	82707	Hagrid	218	" Hagrid , someone 's hurt back there , or cursed , or something — "
82702	82705	82707	82707	Hagrid	218	" Wha ? "
82724	82730	82732	82732	Harry	136	" Someone 's been cursed ! "
82738	82751	82707	82707	Hagrid	218	" Cursed ? Who 's bin cursed — not Ron ? Hermione ? "
82753	82771	82707	82707	Hagrid	218	" No , it 's not them , it 's Katie Bell — this way . . . "
82818	82822	82824	82824	Hagrid	218	" Get back ! "
82826	82831	82824	82824	Hagrid	218	" Lemme see her ! "
82832	82839	82841	82841	Leanne	412	" Something 's happened to her ! "
82843	82850	82841	82841	Leanne	412	" I do n't know what — "
82918	82927	82928	82929	The girl	1349	" It 's Leanne , is n't it ? "
82932	82945	82928	82929	The girl	1349	" Did it just happen all of a sudden , or — ? "
82946	82954	82956	82956	Leanne	412	" It was when that package tore , "
83001	83007	83008	83008	He	136	" Do n't touch it ! "
83025	83032	83034	83034	Harry	136	" I 've seen that before , "
83041	83066	83067	83067	He	136	" It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago . The label said it was cursed . Katie must have touched it . "
83080	83089	83071	83071	Leanne	412	" How did Katie get hold of this ? "
83090	83159	83160	83160	Leanne	412	" Well , that 's why we were arguing . She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it , said it was a sur - prise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it . She looked all funny when she said it . ... Oh no , oh no , I bet she 'd been Imperiused and I did n't realize ! "
83172	83186	83166	83166	Hermione	194	" She did n't say who 'd given it to her , Leanne ? "
83187	83242	83243	83243	Leanne	412	" No . . . she would n't tell me . . . and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school , but she just would n't listen and . . . and then I tried to grab it from her . . . and — and — "
83251	83260	83262	83262	Hermione	194	" We 'd better get up to school , "
83270	83288	83264	83264	her	194	" We 'll be able to find out how she is . Come on . . . . "
83321	83332	83333	83333	he	136	" We 'll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey , "
83371	83433	83358	83358	he	136	" Malfoy knows about this necklace . It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago , I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad . This is what he was buying that day when we followed him ! He remembered it and he went back for it ! "
83435	83443	83445	83445	Ron	217	" I — I dunno , Harry , "
83448	83475	83445	83445	Ron	217	" Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes . . . and did n't that girl say Katie got it in the girls ' bathroom ? "
83476	83499	83505	83505	Ron	217	" She said she came back from the bathroom with it , she did n't necessarily get it in the bathroom itself — "
83500	83503	83505	83505	Ron	217	" McGonagall ! "
83532	83562	83515	83516	Professor McGonagall	251	" Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell — upstairs to my office at once , please ! What 's that you 're holding , Potter ? "
83563	83571	83573	83573	Harry	136	" It 's the thing she touched , "
83575	83579	83581	83582	Professor McGonagall	251	" Good lord , "
83594	83606	83607	83607	she	251	" No , no , Filch , they 're with me ! "
83626	83653	83607	83607	she	251	" Take this necklace to Profes - sor Snape at once , but be sure not to touch it , keep it wrapped in the scarf ! "
83715	83718	83719	83719	she	251	" Well ? "
83723	83727	83719	83719	she	251	" What happened ? "
83820	83824	83826	83827	Professor McGonagall	251	" All right , "
83832	83855	83826	83827	Professor McGonagall	251	" go up to the hospital wing , please , Leanne , and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock . "
83875	83884	83863	83864	Professor McGonagall	251	" What happened when Katie touched the necklace ? "
83885	83893	83895	83895	Harry	136	" She rose up in the air , "
83907	83929	83863	83864	Professor McGonagall	251	" and then began to scream , and collapsed . Profes - sor , can I see Professor Dumbledore , please ? "
83930	83940	83942	83943	Professor McGonagall	251	" The headmaster is away until Monday , Potter , "
83948	83951	83952	83952	Harry	136	" Away ? "
83956	83963	83965	83966	Professor McGonagall	251	" Yes , Potter , away ! "
83969	83992	83965	83966	Professor McGonagall	251	" But any - thing you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me , I 'm sure ! "
84051	84063	84069	84069	him	136	" I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace , Professor . "
84104	84114	84116	84117	Professor McGonagall	251	" That is a very serious accusation , Potter , "
84124	84131	84116	84117	Professor McGonagall	251	" Do you have any proof ? "
84132	84135	84137	84137	Harry	136	" No , "
84139	84143	84145	84145	he	136	" but .. . "
84181	84192	84175	84176	Professor McGonagall	251	" Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair ? "
84193	84245	84170	84170	he	136	" No , Professor , he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something , he did n't have it with him . But that 's not the point , the thing is that he bought something at the same time , and I think it was that necklace — "
84246	84258	84342	84342	Hermione	194	" You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package ? "
84259	84276	84175	84176	Professor McGonagall	251	" No , Professor , he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him — "
84277	84281	84282	84282	Hermione	194	" But Harry , "
84285	84303	84282	84282	Hermione	194	" Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him , and Malfoy said no — "
84304	84316	84318	84318	Harry	136	" Because he did n't want to touch it , obviously ! "
84321	84340	84342	84342	Hermione	194	" What he actually said was , ' How would I look carrying that down the street ? ' "
84344	84359	84342	84342	Hermione	194	" Well , he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace , "
84365	84370	84372	84372	Hermione	194	" Oh , Ron , "
84375	84442	84443	84443	she	194	" it would be all wrapped up , so he would n't have to touch it , and quite easy to hide inside a cloak , so nobody would see it ! I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky , something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street — and in any case , "
84453	84507	84443	84443	she	194	" I asked Borgin about the necklace , do n't you remember ? When I went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep , I saw it there . And Borgin just told me the price , he did n't say it was already sold or anything — "
84508	84550	84558	84559	Professor McGonagall	251	" Well , you were being really obvious , he realized what you were up to within about five seconds , of course he was n't going to tell you — anyway , Malfoy could 've sent off for it since — "
84551	84556	84558	84559	Professor McGonagall	251	" That 's enough ! "
84572	84618	84564	84564	her	194	" Potter , I appreciate you telling me this , but we can not point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased . The same is probably true of hundreds of people — "
84619	84627	84629	84629	Ron	217	" — that 's what I said — "
84631	84667	84629	84629	Ron	217	" — and in any case , we have put stringent security measures in place this year . I do not believe that necklace can possibly have en - tered this school without our knowledge — "
84668	84671	84681	84682	Professor McGonagall	251	" But — "
84672	84679	84681	84682	Professor McGonagall	251	" — and what is more , "
84691	84700	84681	84682	Professor McGonagall	251	" Mr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today . "
84708	84716	84704	84704	her	251	" How do you know , Professor ? "
84717	84752	84753	84753	she	251	" Because he was doing detention with me . He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row . So , thank you for telling me your suspicions , Potter , "
84761	84785	84786	84786	She	251	" but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell . Good day to you all . "
84836	84851	84853	84853	Ron	217	" So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to ? "
84865	84870	84872	84872	Hermione	194	" Goodness only knows , "
84874	84897	84872	84872	Hermione	194	" But whoever it was has had a narrow escape . No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace . "
84898	84909	84911	84911	Harry	136	" It could 've been meant for loads of people , "
84913	84960	84911	84911	Harry	136	" Dumbledore — the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him , he must be one of their top targets . Or Slughorn — Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they ca n't be pleased that he 's sided with Dumbledore . Or — "
84961	84965	84967	84967	Hermione	194	" Or you , "
84972	84978	84980	84980	Harry	136	" Could n't have been , "
84982	85054	84980	84980	Harry	136	" or Katie would 've just turned around in the lane and given it to me , would n't she ? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks . It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts , what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out . I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle ? "
85055	85064	85066	85066	Hermione	194	" Harry , Malfoy was n't in Hogsmeade ! "
85075	85085	85087	85087	Harry	136	" He must have used an accomplice , then , "
85089	85122	85123	85123	Ron	217	" Crabbe or Goyle — or , come to think of it , another Death Eater , he 'll have loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he 's joined up — "
85139	85142	85144	85144	Hermione	194	" Dilligrout , "
85214	85233	85235	85235	Ron	217	" It was n't a very slick attack , really , when you stop and think about it , "
85259	85278	85235	85235	Ron	217	" The curse did n't even make it into the castle . Not what you 'd call foolproof . "
85279	85284	85286	85286	Hermione	194	" You 're right , "
85306	85318	85286	85286	Hermione	194	" It was n't very well thought - out at all . "
85319	85334	85336	85336	Harry	136	" But since when has Malfoy been one of the world 's great thinkers ? "
85415	85425	85427	85427	Harry	136	" Oh , and Malfoy knows , of course , "
85551	85564	85565	85565	Dumbledore	146	" You have had a busy time while I have been away , "
85568	85577	85565	85565	Dumbledore	146	" I believe you witnessed Katie 's accident . "
85578	85587	85525	85525	he	146	" Yes , sir . How is she ? "
85588	85666	85565	85565	Dumbledore	146	" Still very unwell , although she was relatively lucky . She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin ; there was a tiny hole in her glove . Had she put it on , had she even held it in her ungloved hand , she would have died , perhaps instantly . Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse ? quot ; "
85670	85675	85668	85668	him	146	" asked Harry quickly . "
85681	85682	85678	85679	Madam Pomfrey	320	" "
85685	85726	85678	85679	Madam Pomfrey	320	" said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall , and Phineas Nigellus Black , Sirius 's great - great - grandfather , raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping . "
85744	85745	85732	85733	a student	2101	" "
85753	85758	85749	85749	you	0	" said Dumbledore quellingly . "
85801	85802	85788	85788	I	0	" "
85811	85839	85809	85809	sir	985	" Harry asked , disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck , a feeling apparently shared by Phineas Nigellus , who hissed softly . "
85848	85852	85809	85809	sir	985	" said Dumbledore . "
85863	85864	85865	85865	You	0	" "
85868	85874	85865	85865	You	0	" said Harry , startled . "
85881	85906	85865	85865	You	0	" said Dumbledore , withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand . "
85909	85914	85907	85907	Sir	985	" said Harry tentatively , "
85921	85922	85917	85917	Mundungus	410	" "
85943	85951	85952	85952	He	410	" said Dumbledore , frowning a little . "
85994	85995	85979	85979	he	410	" "
86008	86035	86036	86036	Professor	4626	" said Phineas Nigellus , incensed ; and he stalked out of his frame , undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve , Grimmauld Place . "
86038	86047	86036	86036	Professor	4626	" said Harry , after a short pause , "
86066	86067	86068	86068	She	251	" "
86077	86081	86068	86068	She	251	" said Dumbledore . "
86087	86088	86084	86084	you	4626	" "
86109	86113	86089	86089	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
86126	86192	86120	86120	Harry	136	" Harry felt slightly resentful at this : If their lessons were so very important , why had there been such a long gap between the first and second ? However , he said no more about Draco Malfoy , but watched as Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his long - fingered hands . "
86258	86259	86240	86240	Merope	361	" "
86271	86272	86262	86262	you	0	" "
86282	86286	86278	86280	one Caractacus Burke	418	" said Dumbledore , "
86309	86374	86403	86403	She	2114	" He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him swill them before , much as a gold prospector sifts for gold . Up out of the swirling , silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the Pensieve , silver as a ghost but much more solid , with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eyes . "
86538	86565	86566	86566	He	2116	" Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra - vigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come . "
86573	86578	86566	86566	He	2116	" said Harry indignantly . "
86588	86592	86585	86585	his	2116	" said Dumbledore . "
86640	86641	86668	86668	she	2114	" "
86648	86653	86643	86643	she	2114	" said Harry impatiently . "
86670	86671	86668	86668	she	2114	" "
86674	86678	86668	86668	she	2114	" said Dumbledore , "
86777	86778	86779	86779	She	361	" "
86789	86795	86779	86779	She	361	" Dumbledore raised his eyebrows . "
86806	86807	86797	86797	you	0	" "
86810	86815	86797	86797	you	0	" said Harry quickly , "
86833	86841	86843	86843	Dumbledore	146	" Your mother had a choice too , "
86846	86896	86843	86843	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her , but do not judge her too harshly , Harry . She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother 's courage . And now , if you will stand ... "
86897	86903	86904	86904	Harry	136	" Where are we going ? "
86918	86922	86924	86924	Dumbledore	146	" This time , "
86926	86954	86924	86924	Dumbledore	146	" we are going to enter my memory . I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate . After you , Harry ... "
87013	87018	87020	87020	Dumbledore	146	" There I am , "
87089	87095	87097	87097	Harry	136	" Nice suit , sir , "
87176	87199	87169	87174	a scruffy girl wearing an apron	2133	" Good afternoon . I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole , who , I believe , is the matron here ? "
87200	87203	87205	87209	the bewildered - looking girl	2134	" Oh , "
87218	87234	87235	87235	she	2134	" Um . . . just a mo ' . . . MRS . COLE ! "
87258	87269	87251	87252	The girl	1349	" Come in , she 's on ' er way . "
87349	87386	87387	87387	she	2139	" . . . and take the iodine upstairs to Martha , Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley 's oozing all over his sheets ? chicken pox on top of everything else , "
87422	87426	87428	87428	Dumbledore	146	" Good afternoon , "
87440	87464	87435	87436	Mrs. Cole	419	" My name is Albus Dumbledore . I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today . "
87482	87501	87478	87478	she	419	" Oh yes . Well ? well then ? you 'd better come into my room . Yes . "
87554	87577	87579	87579	Dumbledore	146	" I am here , as I told you in my letter , to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future , "
87581	87586	87588	87589	Mrs. Cole	419	" Are you family ? "
87591	87599	87601	87601	Dumbledore	146	" No , I am a teacher , "
87603	87616	87601	87601	Dumbledore	146	" I have come to offer Tom a place at my school . "
87617	87625	87544	87544	herself	419	" What school 's this , then ? "
87626	87632	87634	87634	Dumbledore	146	" It is called Hogwarts , "
87636	87646	87634	87634	Dumbledore	146	" And how come you 're interested in Tom ? "
87647	87658	87544	87544	herself	419	" We believe he has qualities we are looking for . "
87659	87682	87544	87544	herself	419	" You mean he 's won a scholarship ? How can he have done ? He 's never been entered for one . "
87683	87699	87634	87634	Dumbledore	146	" Well , his name has been down for our school since birth ? quot ; "
87707	87762	87544	87544	herself	419	" There was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an inconveniently sharp woman . Apparently Dumbledore thought so too , for Harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit , at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs. Cole 's desktop . "
87765	87782	87544	87544	herself	419	" said Dumbledore , waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper , "
87791	87815	87783	87783	I	0	" Mrs. Cole 's eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment . "
87822	87854	87783	87783	I	0	" she said placidly , handing it back . Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been present a few seconds before . "
87866	87876	87858	87858	I	0	" she said in an extra - refined voice . "
87882	87946	87858	87858	I	0	" said Dumbledore , beaming . It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking . Pouring both of them a generous measure , she drained her own glass in one gulp . Smacking her lips frankly , she smiled at Dumbledore for the first time , and he did n't hesitate to press his advantage . "
87972	87973	87962	87962	I	0	" "
87978	87989	87962	87962	I	0	" said Mrs. Cole , helping herself to more gin . "
88073	88086	88088	88088	she	2150	" Mrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin . "
88095	88099	88088	88088	she	2150	" asked Dumbledore . "
88110	88111	88118	88118	she	2150	" "
88121	88149	88118	88118	she	2150	" said Mrs. Cole , who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now , with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story . "
88252	88309	88243	88243	she	2150	" Well , we named him just as she 'd said , it seemed so important to the poor girl , but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him , nor any family at all , so he stayed in the orphanage and he 's been here ever since . "
88339	88346	88336	88336	she	419	" He 's a funny boy . "
88347	88350	88352	88352	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , "
88354	88361	88352	88352	Dumbledore	146	" I thought he might be . "
88362	88395	88336	88336	she	419	" He was a funny baby too . He hardly ever cried , you know . And then , when he got a little older , he was . . . odd . "
88396	88402	88404	88404	Dumbledore	146	" Odd in what way ? "
88407	88440	88404	88404	Dumbledore	146	" Well , he ? quot ; But Mrs. Cole pulled up short , and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot Dumbledore over her gin glass . "
88454	88455	88451	88451	you	419	" "
88458	88462	88451	88451	you	419	" said Dumbledore . "
88471	88472	88465	88465	I	0	" "
88475	88479	88480	88480	You	419	" said Dumbledore . "
88489	88490	88480	88480	You	419	" "
88493	88526	88527	88527	He	2162	" repeated Dumbledore gravely . She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him . Apparently she decided she could , because she said in a sudden rush , "
88533	88534	88535	88535	You	419	" "
88542	88546	88549	88549	he	2162	" asked Dumbledore . "
88553	88561	88549	88549	he	2162	" said Mrs. Cole , frowning slightly , "
88584	88615	88616	88617	Billy Stubbs	241	" Dumbledore did not press her , though Harry could tell that he was interested . She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still . "
88659	88660	88661	88661	I	0	" "
88669	88674	88661	88661	I	0	" said Dumbledore quietly . "
88706	88725	88695	88695	he	2162	" ? Mrs. Cole took another swig of gin , slopping a little over her chin this time ? "
88822	88842	88843	88843	I	0	" She looked around at Dumbledore again , and though her cheeks were flushed , her gaze was steady . "
88859	88860	88861	88861	You	0	" "
88877	88881	88869	88869	we	2167	" said Dumbledore . "
88897	88898	88869	88869	we	2167	" "
88917	88956	88957	88957	I	0	" said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup . She got to her feet , and Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady , even though two - thirds of the gin was now gone . "
88966	88967	88959	88959	you	0	" "
88971	89045	88959	88959	you	0	" said Dumbledore , rising too . She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs , calling out instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed . The orphans , Harry saw , were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic . They looked reasonably well - cared for , but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up . "
89050	89079	89080	89080	Tom	379	" said Mrs. Cole , as they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor . She knocked twice and entered . "
89113	89236	89106	89106	I	0	" Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room , and Mrs. Cole closed the door on them . It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe and an iron bedstead . A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets , his legs stretched out in front of him , holding a book . There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle 's face . Merope had got her dying wish : He was his handsome father in miniature , tall for eleven years old , dark - haired , and pale . His eyes narrowed slightly as he took in Dumbledore 's eccentric appearance . There was a moment 's silence . "
89244	89294	89239	89239	you	2177	" said Dumbledore , walking forward and holding out his hand . The boy hesitated , then took it , and they shook hands . Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle , so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor . "
89300	89301	89297	89298	Professor Dumbledore	146	" "
89306	89314	89297	89298	Professor Dumbledore	146	" repeated Riddle . He looked wary . "
89340	89355	89329	89329	she	2179	" He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just left . "
89360	89366	89329	89329	she	2179	" said Dumbledore , smiling . "
89373	89377	89371	89371	you	0	" said Riddle . "
89392	89465	89386	89386	she	2179	" He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was almost shocking . It was a command , and it sounded as though he had given it many times before . His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore , who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly . After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring , though he looked , if anything , warier still . "
89470	89471	89472	89472	I	0	" "
89514	89538	89539	89539	You	0	" Riddle 's reaction to this was most surprising . He leapt from the bed and backed away from Dumbledore , looking furious . "
89613	89621	89623	89623	Dumbledore	146	" I am not from the asylum , "
89626	89667	89623	89623	Dumbledore	146	" I am a teacher and , if you will sit down calmly , I shall tell you about Hogwarts . Of course , if you would rather not come to the school , nobody will force you ? quot ; "
89676	89680	89668	89668	I	0	" sneered Riddle . "
89683	89699	89668	89668	I	0	" Dumbledore went on , as though he had not heard Riddle 's last words , "
89711	89717	89668	89668	I	0	" I 'm not mad ! "
89718	89743	89757	89757	his	379	" I know that you are not mad . Hogwarts is not a school for mad people . It is a school of magic . "
89780	89783	89784	89784	he	379	" Magic ? "
89790	89795	89797	89797	Dumbledore	146	" That 's right , "
89799	89814	89797	89797	Dumbledore	146	" It 's . . . it 's magic , what I can do ? "
89815	89824	89784	89784	he	379	" What is it that you can do ? "
89825	89829	89831	89831	Riddle	379	" All sorts , "
89851	89899	89847	89847	he	379	" I can make filings move without touching them . I can make animals do what I want them to do , without training them . I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me . I can make them hurt if I want to . "
89929	89936	89937	89937	he	379	" I knew I was different , "
89945	89960	89937	89937	he	379	" I knew I was special . Always , I knew there was something . "
89961	89969	89971	89971	Dumbledore	146	" Well , you were quite right , "
89984	89990	89991	89991	Riddle	379	" You are a wizard . "
90038	90045	90033	90033	his	379	" Are you a wizard too ? "
90046	90052	90068	90068	he	379	" Yes , I am . "
90053	90057	90059	90059	Riddle	379	" Prove it , "
90076	90081	90072	90072	he	379	" Tell the truth . "
90087	90103	90084	90084	his	146	" If , as I take it , you are accepting your place at Hogwarts?quot ; "
90109	90110	90084	90084	his	146	" "
90125	90145	90112	90112	you	146	" Riddle 's expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said , in an unrecognizably polite voice , "
90165	90318	90160	90160	you	985	" Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse , that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts , that they were currently in a building full of Muggles and must therefore be cautious . To his great surprise , however , Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket , pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner , and gave the wand a casual flick . The wardrobe burst into flames . Riddle jumped to his feet ; Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage ; all his worldly possessions must be in there . But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore , the flames vanished , leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged . Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore ; then , his expression greedy , he pointed at the wand . "
90327	90328	90160	90160	you	985	" "
90334	90338	90160	90160	you	985	" said Dumbledore . "
90352	90376	90339	90339	I	0	" And sure enough , a faint rattling could be heard from inside it . For the first time , Riddle looked frightened . "
90381	90430	90339	90339	I	0	" said Dumbledore . Riddle hesitated , then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door . On the topmost shelf , above a rail of threadbare clothes , a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it . "
90435	90450	90339	90339	I	0	" said Dumbledore . Riddle took down the quaking box . He looked unnerved . "
90464	90479	90482	90482	I	0	" asked Dumbledore . Riddle threw Dumbledore a long , clear , calculating look . "
90488	90498	90486	90486	sir	985	" he said finally , in an expressionless voice . "
90502	90577	90486	90486	sir	985	" said Dumbledore . Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed without looking at them . Harry , who had expected something much more exciting , saw a mess of small , everyday objects : a yo - yo , a silver thimble , and a tarnished mouth organ among them . Once free of the box , they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets . "
90589	90602	90586	90586	your	0	" said Dumbledore calmly , putting his wand back into his jacket . "
90623	90650	90653	90653	sir	985	" Riddle did not look remotely abashed ; he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore . At last he said in a colorless voice , "
90655	90656	90653	90653	sir	985	" "
90660	90665	90666	90666	we	2200	" Dumbledore went on , "
90777	90778	90781	90781	sir	985	" "
90783	90831	90781	90781	sir	985	" said Riddle again . It was impossible to tell what he was thinking ; his face remained quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box . When he had finished , he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly , "
90839	90840	90781	90781	sir	985	" "
90846	90860	90781	90781	sir	985	" said Dumbledore , drawing a leather money - pouch from his pocket . "
90896	90903	90905	90905	Riddle	379	" Where do you buy spellbooks ? "
90927	90932	90934	90934	Dumbledore	146	" In Diagon Alley , "
90936	90958	90934	90934	Dumbledore	146	" I have your list of books and school equipment with me . I can help you find everything ? quot ; "
90965	90972	90934	90934	Dumbledore	146	" asked Riddle , looking up . "
90980	90987	90989	90989	Riddle	379	" I do n't need you , "
90991	91023	91024	91024	he	379	" I 'm used to doing things for myself , I go round London on my own all the time . How do you get to this Diagon Alley ? sir ? "
91079	91138	91076	91076	he	146	" You will be able to see it , although Muggles around you ? non - magical people , that is ? will not . Ask for Tom the barman ? easy enough to remember , as he shares your name ? quot ; Riddle gave an irritable twitch , as though trying to displace an irksome fly . "
91147	91148	91076	91076	he	146	" "
91156	91185	91154	91154	Toms	427	" muttered Riddle . Then , as though he could not suppress the question , as though it burst from him in spite of himself , he asked , "
91204	91205	91199	91199	they	2214	" "
91214	91222	91209	91209	I	0	" said Dumbledore , his voice gentle . "
91238	91248	91253	91253	him	5086	" said Riddle , more to himself than Dumbledore . "
91271	91272	91253	91253	him	5086	" "
91287	91291	91253	91253	him	5086	" said Dumbledore . "
91315	91337	91338	91338	I	0	" Riddle nodded . Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again . Taking it , Riddle said , "
91373	91394	91361	91361	they	2218	" Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment , determined to impress . "
91399	91409	91361	91361	they	2218	" said Dumbledore , after a moment 's hesitation , "
91415	91457	91361	91361	they	2218	" His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle 's face . They stood for a moment , man and boy , staring at each other . Then the handshake was broken ; Dumbledore was at the door . "
91471	91472	91473	91473	I	0	" "
91479	91514	91473	91473	I	0	" said the white - haired Dumbledore at Harry 's side , and seconds later , they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more , before landing squarely in the present - day office . "
91518	91540	91541	91541	He	2222	" said Dumbledore , landing beside Harry . Harry obeyed , his mind still full of what he had just seen . "
91562	91566	91554	91554	you	0	" said Harry . "
91580	91581	91576	91576	he	2222	" "
91603	91607	91596	91596	his	2222	" said Dumbledore . "
91614	91618	91609	91609	you	0	" asked Harry . "
91636	91640	91609	91609	you	0	" said Dumbledore . "
91717	91839	91849	91849	Harry	136	" His powers , as you heard , were surprisingly well - developed for such a young wizard and ? most interestingly and ominously of all ? he had already discovered that he had some measure of control over them , and begun to use them consciously . And as you saw , they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards : He was already using magic against other people , to frighten , to punish , to control . The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive . . . . ' I can make them hurt if I want to . . . . ' "
91840	91847	91849	91849	Harry	136	" And he was a Parselmouth , "
91851	91913	91849	91849	Harry	136	" Yes , indeed ; a rare ability , and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts , although as we know , there are Parselmouths among the great and the good too . In fact , his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty , secrecy , and domination . "
91922	91934	91849	91849	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore , indicating the dark sky beyond the windows . "
91974	91998	91999	91999	Harry	136	" Firstly , I hope you noticed Riddle 's reaction when I mentioned that another shared his first name , ' Tom ' ? "
92002	92071	91999	91999	Harry	136	" There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people , anything that made him ordinary . Even then , he wished to be different , separate , notorious . He shed his name , as you know , within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of Lord Voldemort ' behind which he has been hidden for so long . "
92174	92258	92168	92168	he	379	" And lastly ? I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this , Harry ? the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies . You saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room . These were taken from victims of his bullying behavior , souvenirs , if you will , of particularly unpleasant bits of magic . Bear in mind this magpie - like tendency , for this , particularly , will be important later . "
92269	92311	92314	92314	Harry	136	" Harry got to his feet . As he walked across the room , his eyes fell I upon the little table on which Marvolo Gaunt 's ring had rested last I time , but the ring was no longer there . "
92316	92329	92314	92314	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore , for Harry had come to a halt . I "
92335	92342	92314	92314	Harry	136	" said Harry , looking around . "
92356	92373	92377	92377	Harry	136	" Dumbledore beamed at him , peering over the top of his hall ' moon spectacles . "
92390	92407	92377	92377	Harry	136	" And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry , who understood himself to be dismissed .
92493	92507	92509	92509	Ron	217	" Wow , scary thought , the boy You - Know - Who , "
92540	92571	92509	92509	Ron	217	" But I still do n't get why Dumbledore 's showing you all this . I mean , it 's really interesting and everything , but what 's the point ? "
92572	92575	92577	92577	Harry	136	" Dunno , "
92584	92598	92577	92577	Harry	136	" But he says its all important and it 'll help me survive . "
92599	92606	92608	92608	Hermione	194	" I think it 's fascinating , "
92611	92634	92608	92608	Hermione	194	" It makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible . How else will you find out his weaknesses ? "
92635	92644	92645	92645	Harry	136	" So how was Slughorn 's latest party ? "
92654	92664	92666	92666	Hermione	194	" Oh , it was quite fun , really , "
92674	92716	92666	92666	Hermione	194	" I mean , he drones on about famous exploits a bit , and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he 's so well connected , but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones . "
92717	92721	92723	92723	Ron	217	" Gwenog Jones ? "
92733	92744	92725	92725	his	217	" The Gwenog Jones ? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies ? "
92745	92750	92752	92752	Hermione	194	" That 's right , "
92754	92769	92752	92752	Hermione	194	" Personally , I thought she was a bit full of herself , but — "
92770	92777	92779	92780	Professor Sprout	344	" Quite enough chat over here ! "
92789	92809	92779	92780	Professor Sprout	344	" You 're lagging behind , everybody else has started , and Neville 's already got his first pod ! "
92849	92859	92861	92861	Ron	217	" Okay , Professor , we 're starting now ! "
92873	92881	92867	92867	she	194	" should ve used Muffliato , Harry . "
92882	92889	92898	92898	she	194	" No , we should n't ! "
92917	92930	92931	92931	She	194	" Well , come on ... we 'd better get going . ... "
93103	93129	93131	93131	Ron	217	" You know , I do n't think I 'll be having any of these in my garden when I 've got my own place , "
93147	93153	93155	93155	Hermione	194	" Pass me a bowl , "
93186	93204	93206	93207	Professor Sprout	344	" Do n't be squeamish , squeeze it out , they 're best when they 're fresh ! "
93209	93212	93214	93214	Hermione	194	" Anyway , "
93234	93287	93288	93288	Harry	136	" Slughorn 's going to have a Christmas party , Harry , and there 's no way you 'll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings , so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come . "
93327	93342	93293	93293	Ron	217	" And this is another party just for Slughorn 's favorites , is it ? "
93343	93352	93354	93354	Hermione	194	" Just for the Slug Club , yes , "
93406	93421	93402	93402	Hermione	194	" Look , I did n't make up the name ' Slug Club ' — "
93422	93425	93426	93426	Ron	217	" ' Slug Club,'"repeated
93434	93468	93402	93402	Hermione	194	" It 's pathetic . Well , I hope you enjoy your party . Why do n't you try hooking up with McLaggen , then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug — "
93469	93477	93479	93479	Hermione	194	" We 're allowed to bring guests , "
93493	93518	93479	93479	Hermione	194	" and I was going to ask you to come , but if you think it 's that stupid then I wo n't bother ! "
93592	93600	93602	93602	Ron	217	" You were going to ask me ? "
93612	93615	93617	93617	Hermione	194	" Yes , "
93620	93633	93617	93617	Hermione	194	" But obviously if you 'd rather 1 hooked up with McLaggen ... "
93650	93657	93659	93659	Ron	217	" No , I would n't , "
93681	93684	93686	93686	he	136	" Reparo , "
93734	93742	93694	93694	his	136	“ Flesh - Eating Trees of the World ”
93770	93777	93779	93779	Hermione	194	" Hand that over , Harry , "
93782	93798	93779	93779	Hermione	194	" It says we 're supposed to puncture them with something sharp . . . . "
93992	93995	93997	93997	Ron	217	" Gotcha ! "
94276	94285	94297	94297	Dean	261	" Are you still interested in playing Chaser ? "
94286	94295	94297	94297	Dean	261	" Wha — ? Yeah , of course ! "
94373	94381	94383	94383	Harry	136	" Well then , you 're in , "
94385	94395	94383	94383	Harry	136	" There 's a practice tonight , seven o'clock . "
94396	94399	94401	94401	Dean	261	" Right , "
94403	94418	94419	94419	He	261	" Cheers , Harry ! Blimey , I ca n't wait to tell Ginny ! "
94715	94730	94731	94731	Ron	217	" It was an accident , I 'm sorry , Demelza , really sorry ! "
94747	94751	94731	94731	Ron	217	" I just — "
94752	94755	94756	94756	Ginny	236	" Panicked , "
94770	94783	94756	94756	Ginny	236	" You prat , Ron , look at the state of her ! "
94784	94790	94792	94792	Harry	136	" I can fix that , "
94809	94812	94801	94801	his	136	" Episkey . "
94813	94833	94801	94801	his	136	" And Ginny , do n't call Ron a prat , you 're not the Captain of this team — "
94834	94852	94853	94853	Harry	136	" Well , you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should — "
94860	94874	94853	94853	Harry	136	" In the air , everyone , let 's go . . . . "
94909	94922	94923	94923	he	136	" Good work , everyone , I think we 'll flatten Slytherin , "
94942	94952	94954	94954	Ron	217	" I played like a sack of dragon dung , "
94968	94975	94977	94977	Harry	136	" No , you did n't , "
94980	94998	94977	94977	Harry	136	" You 're the best Keeper I tried out , Ron . Your only problem is nerves . "
95141	95144	95130	95130	Ron	217	“ Oi ! ”
95154	95157	95159	95159	Ginny	236	" What ? "
95161	95176	95159	95159	Ginny	236	" I do n't want to find my own sister snogging people in public ! "
95177	95189	95191	95191	Ginny	236	" This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in ! "
95229	95239	95241	95241	Dean	261	" Er . . . c'm on , Ginny , "
95243	95254	95241	95241	Dean	261	" let 's go back to the common room . ... "
95255	95259	95261	95261	Ginny	236	" You go ! "
95263	95273	95274	95274	Dean	261	" I want a word with my dear brother ! "
95289	95292	95294	95294	Ginny	236	" Right , "
95310	95341	95297	95297	her	236	" let 's get this straight once and for all . It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them , Ron — "
95342	95348	95350	95350	Ron	217	" Yeah , it is ! "
95356	95372	95350	95350	Ron	217	" D ' you think I want peo - ple saying my sister 's a — "
95373	95377	95379	95379	Ginny	236	" A what ? "
95385	95391	95379	95379	Ginny	236	" A what , exactly ? "
95392	95401	95403	95406	Harry automati - cally	136	" He does n't mean anything , Ginny — "
95420	95426	95427	95427	she	236	" Oh yes he does ! "
95435	95462	95427	95427	she	236	" Just because he 's never snogged anyone in his life , just because the best kiss he 's ever had is from our Auntie Muriel — "
95463	95468	95470	95470	Ron	217	" Shut your mouth ! "
95478	95485	95487	95487	Ginny	236	" No , I will not ! "
95492	95544	95487	95487	Ginny	236	" I 've seen you with Phlegm , hoping she 'll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her , it 's pathetic ! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done your self , you would n't mind so much that everyone else does it ! "
95559	95570	95571	95571	Ron	217	" You do n't know what you 're talking about ! "
95598	95610	95611	95611	Ginny	236	" Just because I do n't do it in public — ! "
95626	95648	95611	95611	Ginny	236	" Been kissing Pigwidgeon , have you ? Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow ? "
95675	95681	95667	95667	Harry	136	" Do n't be stupid — "
95682	95689	95691	95691	Ginny	236	" Harry 's snogged Cho Chang ! "
95700	95740	95745	95745	she	236	" And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum , it 's only you who acts like it 's something disgusting , Ron , and that 's because you 've got about as much experience as a twelve - year - old ! "
95794	95798	95800	95800	Harry	136	" C'm on , "
95827	95835	95836	95836	Ron	217	" Oi , out of the way ! "
95970	95974	95962	95962	his	217	" betrayal of trust "
95978	95984	95962	95962	his	217	" supposed to be my friend "
95988	95996	95997	95997	Ron	217	" D'you think Hermione did snog Krum ? "
96036	96039	96040	96040	he	136	" What ? "
96044	96049	96040	96040	he	136	" Oh ... er ... "
96054	96057	96059	96059	he	136	" yes , "
96083	96086	96087	96087	he	217	" Dilligrout , "
96559	96568	96570	96570	Peakes	395	" You shut up and leave her alone ! "
96589	96592	96594	96594	Harry	136	" ENOUGH ! "
96636	96662	96663	96663	he	217	" Peakes , go and pack up the Bludgers . Demelza , pull yourself together , you played really well today , Ron . . . "
96679	96707	96663	96663	he	217	" you 're my best mate , but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I 'm going to kick you off the team . "
96746	96754	96743	96743	he	217	" I resign . I 'm pathetic . "
96755	96766	96768	96768	Harry	136	" You 're not pathetic and you 're not resigning ! "
96780	96802	96743	96743	he	217	" You can save any - thing when you 're on form , it 's a mental problem you 've got ! "
96803	96809	96743	96743	he	217	" You calling me mental ? "
96810	96817	96818	96818	They	2302	" Yeah , maybe I am ! "
96834	96873	96830	96830	his	217	" I know you have n't got any time to find another Keeper , so I 'll play tomorrow , but if we lose , and we will , I 'm tak - ing myself off the team . "
97230	97236	97238	97238	Lavender	343	" Cheer up , Ron ! "
97240	97248	97238	97238	Lavender	343	" I know you 'll be brilliant ! "
97254	97257	97258	97258	Harry	136	" Tea ? "
97262	97268	97258	97258	Harry	136	" Coffee ? Pumpkin juice ? "
97269	97272	97274	97274	Ron	217	" Anything , "
97320	97327	97328	97328	she	194	" How are you both feeling ? "
97342	97345	97347	97347	Harry	136	" Fine , "
97361	97371	97372	97372	Ron	217	" There you go , Ron . Drink up . "
97386	97394	97382	97382	Hermione	194	" Do n't drink that , Ron ! "
97404	97408	97410	97410	Ron	217	" Why not ? "
97429	97438	97420	97420	she	194	" You just put something in that drink . "
97439	97443	97445	97445	Harry	136	" Excuse me ? "
97447	97476	97445	97445	Harry	136	" You heard me . I saw you . You just tipped something into Ron 's drink . You 've got the bottle in your hand right now ! "
97477	97488	97490	97490	Harry	136	" I do nt know what you 're talking about , "
97501	97513	97514	97514	Hermione	194	" Ron , I warn you , do n't drink it ! "
97536	97544	97521	97521	Ron	217	" Stop bossing me around , Hermione . "
97562	97581	97559	97559	she	194	" You should be expelled for that . I 'd never have believed it of you , Harry ! "
97582	97588	97589	97589	he	136	" Look who 's talking , "
97593	97598	97599	97599	She	194	" Confunded anyone lately ? "
97640	97661	97632	97632	Ron	217	" Nearly time/ ' said Harry blithely . The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium . "
97671	97676	97632	97632	Ron	217	" Harry asked Ron . "
97679	97707	97632	97632	Ron	217	" said Ron , who was pale and sick - looking . Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room . "
97712	97719	97632	97632	Ron	217	" said Ginny , ignoring Ron . "
97762	97763	97755	97755	Malfoy	170	" "
97766	97777	97755	97755	Malfoy	170	" said Harry , wheeling around to stare at her . "
97788	97789	97755	97755	Malfoy	170	" "
97800	97805	97806	97806	They	2315	" said Ginny brightly . "
97823	97901	97818	97818	he	434	" Harry smiled back vaguely , but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch . Malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury , but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the Slytherins better . Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on ? Was he really ill , or was he faking ? "
97908	97917	97902	97902	Fishy	443	" he said in an undertone to Ron . "
97922	97923	97918	97918	Malfoy	170	" "
97930	97939	97918	97918	Malfoy	170	" said Ron , looking slightly more animated . "
97959	97977	97952	97952	I	0	" he said suddenly , freezing halfway through pulling on his Keepers gloves and staring at Harry . "
97980	97981	97982	97982	I	0	" "
97988	98002	97984	97984	you	0	" Ron had dropped his voice , he looked both scared and excited . "
98015	98026	98010	98010	you	0	" Harry raised his eyebrows , but said nothing except , "
98044	98133	98134	98134	Captains	5191	" They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos . One end of the stadium was solid red and gold ; the other , a sea of green and silver . Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too : Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegood 's famous lion - topped hat . Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch , the referee , who was stand - ing ready to release the balls from the crate . "
98138	98156	98134	98134	Captains	5191	" she said , and Harry had his hand crushed by the new Slytherin Captain , Urquhart . "
98179	98244	98248	98248	they	2321	" The whistle sounded , Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground , and they were away . Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds , looking around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper , who was zigzagging far below him . Then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual commentator 's started up . "
98309	98380	98301	98302	the Captain	5420	" These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin end of the pitch . Harry craned around on his broom to look toward the commentator 's podium . A call , skinny blond buy with an upturned nose was standing there , talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan 's ; Harry recognized Zacharias Smith , a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked . "
98402	98408	98410	98410	Weasley	220	" Harrys stomach turned over . "
98430	98431	98416	98416	he	220	" "
98441	98545	98438	98438	he	220	" muttered Harry , grinning to him - self , as he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive Snitch . With half an hour of the game gone , Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero , Ron having made some truly spectacular saves , some by the very tips of his gloves , and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindor 's six goals . This effectively stopped Zacharias won - dering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Harry liked them , and he started on Peakes and Coote instead . "
98560	98565	98438	98438	he	220	" said Zacharias loftily , "
98575	98576	98566	98566	they	2328	" "
98583	98697	98698	98698	Weasley	217	" Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past , but Coote , grinning broadly , chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead , who was just passing Harry in the opposite direc - tion . Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its mark . It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong . Again and again they scored , and again and again , at the other end of the pitch , Ron saved goals with apparent ease . He was actually smiling now , and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a rousing chorus of the old favorite "
98703	98715	98698	98698	Weasley	217	" he pre - tended to conduct them from on high . "
98727	98750	98725	98725	he	217	" said a snide voice , and Harry was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper collided with him hard and deliberately . "
98757	98806	98808	98808	I	0	" Madam Hooch 's back was turned , and though Gryffindors be - low shouted in anger , by the time she looked around , Harper had already sped off . His shoulder aching , Harry raced after him , de - termined to ram him back . ... "
98818	98826	98829	98829	he	217	" said Zacharias Smith through his megaphone . "
98838	98976	98834	98834	Potter	136	" Smith really was an idiot , thought Harry , had n't he noticed them collide ? But next moment , his stomach seemed to drop out of the , sky — Smith was right and Harry was wrong : Harper had not sped upward at random ; he had spotted what Harry had not : The Snitch was speeding along high above them , glinting brightly against the clear blue sky . Harry accelerated ; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of Smith 's commentary or the crowd , but Harper was still ahead of him , and Gryffindor was only a hundred points up ; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost . . . and now Harper was feet from it , his hand outstretched . ... "
98981	98987	98979	98979	Harper	442	" yelled Harry in desperation . "
99001	99055	98991	98991	Malfoy	170	" He did not know what made him say it , but Harper did a dou - ble - take ; he fumbled the Snitch , let it slip through his fingers , and shot right past it . Harry made a great swipe for the tiny , fluttering ball and caught it . "
99058	99109	98991	98991	Malfoy	170	" Hairy yelled . Wheeling around , he hurtled back toward the ground , the Snitch held high in his hand . As the crowd realized what had happened , a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game . "
99117	99198	99203	99203	Professor	4626	" yelled Harry , who had found hint self trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of tin1 team , but Ginny sped right on past them until , with an almighty crash , she collided with the commentators podium . As the crowd shrieked and laughed , the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring , : Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall , "
99207	99275	99203	99203	Professor	4626	" Laughing , Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny , but let go very quickly . Avoiding her gaze , he clapped cheering Ron on the back instead as , all enmity forgotten , the Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm , punching the air ami waving to their supporters . The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant . "
99286	99291	99283	99283	Seamus	330	" yelled Dean exuberantly . "
99299	99337	99295	99295	Ginny	236	" Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room . They were just about to leave when Hermione entered . She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined . "
99347	99354	99345	99345	Harry	136	" She took a deep breath . "
99369	99370	99364	99364	Slughorn	216	" "
99382	99386	99373	99373	you	2335	" demanded Ron . "
99394	99415	99389	99389	you	2336	" asked Harry , turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning , "
99426	99431	99432	99432	You	2335	" said Hermione shrilly . "
99445	99446	99432	99432	You	2335	" "
99453	99464	99449	99449	I	0	" said Harry , turning back to face them both . "
99489	99490	99485	99485	Ron	217	" "
99498	99545	99491	99491	I	0	" said Harry , grinning broadly . He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning . It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax . "
99569	99575	99576	99576	You	217	" He looked at Ron . "
99590	99597	99588	99588	yourself	217	" He pocketed the potion again . "
99608	99614	99588	99588	yourself	217	" Ron said , astounded . "
99639	99663	99664	99664	You	217	" ] Harry shook his head . Ron gaped at him for a moment , then rounded on Hermione , imitating her voice . "
99693	99694	99691	99691	Hermione	358	" "
99713	99732	99704	99704	you	217	" But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder . "
99735	99754	99704	99704	you	217	" said Harry into the sudden silence ; he had not expected his plan to backfire like this , "
99769	99770	99771	99771	You	217	" "
99774	99782	99771	99771	You	217	" said Hermione , blinking back tears . "
99807	100063	99797	99797	I	0	" And she stormed out of the changing room too . Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd , many of whom shouted congratulations at him , but he felt a great sense of letdown ; he had been sure that if Ron won the match , he and Hermione would be friends again immediately . He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermi - one that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum , not when the offense had occurred so long ago . Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party , which was in full swing when he arrived . Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance , and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him . What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers , who wanted a blow - by - blow match analysis , and the large group of girls that encircled him , laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids , it was some time before he could try and find Ron . At last , he extricated him - self from Romilda Vane , who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughorn 's Christmas party with him . As he was duck - ing toward the drinks table , he walked straight into Ginny , Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels . "
100068	100074	99797	99797	I	0	" she asked , smirking . "
100084	100122	100075	100075	He	217	" Harry looked into the corner she was indicating . There , in full view of the whole room , stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose . "
100136	100143	100126	100126	he	217	" said Ginny dispas - sionately . "
100161	100277	100159	100159	Harry	136	" She patted him on the arm ; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach , but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer . Crookshanks trotted after her , his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold . Harry turned away from Ron , who did not look like he would be surfacing soon , just as the portrait hole was closing . With a sinking feeling , he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whip - ping out of sight . He darted forward , sidestepped Romilda Vane again , and pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady . The corridor outside , seemed to be deserted . "
100280	100342	100159	100159	Harry	136	" He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried . She was sitting on the teacher 's desk , alone except for a small ring of twit - tering yellow birds circling her head , which she had clearly just conjured out of midair . Harry could not help admiring her spell - work at a time like this . "
100349	100357	100347	100347	Harry	136	" she said in a brittle voice . "
100363	100364	100358	100358	I	0	" "
100378	100436	100437	100437	Ron	217	" said Harry . He had no idea what to say to her . He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron , that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy , when she said , in an unnaturally high - pitched voice , "
100445	100446	100452	100452	he	217	" "
100454	100458	100452	100452	he	217	" said Harry . "
100468	100472	100462	100462	you	136	" said Hermione . "
100483	100510	100473	100473	He	217	" The door behind them burst open . To Harry 's horror , Ron came in , laughing , pulling Lavender by the hand . ; ' "
100513	100528	100473	100473	He	217	" he said , drawing up short at the sight of Harry and Hermione . "
100531	100588	100473	100473	He	217	" said Lavender , and she backed out of the room , gig - gling . The door swung shut behind her . There was a horrible , swelling , billowing silence . Hermione was staring at Ron , who refused to look at her , but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness , "
100600	100638	100639	100639	You	136	" Hermione slid off the desk . The little flock of golden birds con - tinued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange , feathery model of the solar system . "
100647	100652	100653	100653	She	343	" she said quietly . "
100661	100687	100653	100653	She	343	" She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door . Harry glanced at Ron , who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened . "
100690	100758	100653	100653	She	343	" came a shriek from the doorway . Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron , her expression wild : The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron , who yelped and covered his face with his hands , but the birds attacked , pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach . "
100761	100793	100653	100653	She	343	" he yelled , but with one last look of vindictive fury , Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it . Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed .
101086	101092	101093	101093	he	217	" She ca n't complain , "
101097	101129	101093	101093	he	217	" She snogged Krum . So she 's found out someone wants to snog me too . Well , it 's a free country . I have n't done anything wrong . "
101187	101194	101195	101195	Ron	217	" I never promised Hermione anything , "
101198	101233	101195	101195	Ron	217	" I mean , all right , I was going to go to Slughorn 's Christmas party with her , but she never said ... just as friends ... I 'm a free agent ... "
101273	101275	101248	101248	Ron	217	" Krum "
101277	101281	101248	101248	Ron	217	" Ca n't complain "
101357	101369	101371	101371	Hermione	358	" He 's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes , "
101386	101394	101395	101395	She	358	" I really could n't care less . "
101469	101473	101475	101475	Hermione	358	" And incidentally , "
101482	101489	101475	101475	Hermione	358	" you need to be careful . "
101490	101496	101498	101498	Harry	136	" For the last time , "
101518	101546	101498	101498	Harry	136	" I am not giving back this book . I 've learned more from the Half - blood p rince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in-- "
101547	101560	101562	101562	Hermione	358	" I 'm not talking about your stupid so - called prince , "
101579	101667	101562	101562	Hermione	358	" I 'm talki ng about earlier . I went into the girl 's bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there , including that Romilda Vane , trying to decide how to slip you a love potion . They 're all hoping they 're going to get you to take them to Slughorn 's party , and thay all seem to have bought Fred and George 's love potions , which I 'm afraid to say probably work -- "
101668	101677	101679	101679	Harry	136	" Why did n't you confiscate them then ? "
101702	101715	101717	101717	Hermione	358	" They did n't have the potions with them in the bathroom , "
101720	101735	101736	101736	she	358	" They were just discussing tactics . As I doubt the Half - blood prince "
101743	101794	101736	101736	she	358	" could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once , I 'd just invite someone to go with you , that 'll stop all the others thinking they 've still got a chance . It 's tomor r ow night , they 're getting desperate . "
101795	101805	101807	101807	Harry	136	" There is n't anyone I want to invite , "
101852	101872	101874	101874	Hermione	358	" Well , just be careful what you drink , because Romilda Va ne looked like she meant business . "
101918	101924	101925	101925	he	136	" Hang on a moment , "
101929	101943	101925	101925	he	136	" I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasley 's Wizard Wheezes ? "
101944	101958	101960	101960	Hermione	358	" And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned ? "
101968	101994	101960	101960	Hermione	358	" But I thought all the owls were being searched . So how come these grils are able to bring love potions into the school ? "
101995	102008	102010	102010	Hermione	358	" Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions , "
102012	102022	102010	102010	Hermione	358	" It 's part of their Owl order service . "
102023	102031	102032	102032	Hermione	358	" You know a lot about it . "
102052	102071	102072	102072	she	358	" It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer , "
102076	102102	102072	102072	she	358	" I do n't go around putting potions in people 's drinks ... or pretending too eit h er , which is just as bad ... "
102103	102112	102114	102114	Harry	136	" Yeah , well , never mind that , "
102117	102157	102114	102114	Harry	136	" The point is , Filch is being fooled is n't he ? These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else ! So why could n't Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school -- ? "
102158	102167	102072	102072	she	358	" Oh , Harry ... not that again ... "
102168	102175	102177	102177	Harry	136	" Come on , why not ? "
102179	102182	102184	102184	Hermione	358	" Look , "
102186	102263	102184	102184	Hermione	358	" Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes , curses , and concealment charms , do n't they ? They 're used to find d ark magic and d ark obje c ts . They 'd have picked up a powerful curse , like the one in the necklace , withi n seconds . But something that 's just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn ' t register -- anyway Love potions are n't d ark or dangerous --- "
102264	102271	102273	102273	Harry	136	" Easy for you to say , "
102280	102316	102317	102317	Hermione	358	" -- so it would be down to Filch to realise it was n't a cough potion , and he 's not a very good wizard , I doubt he can tell one potion from -- "
102379	102386	102387	102387	she	358	" The library is now closed , "
102390	102415	102387	102387	she	358	" Mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct -- what have you been doing to that book , you depraved boy ? "
102416	102428	102430	102430	Harry	136	" It is n't the library 's , it 's mine ! "
102454	102457	102458	102458	she	358	" Spoiled ! "
102461	102466	102458	102458	she	358	" Desecrated , befouled ! "
102467	102479	102481	102481	Harry	136	" It 's just a book that 's been written on ! "
102519	102543	102500	102500	Hermione	358	" She 'll ban you from the library if you 're not careful . Why did you have to bring that stupid book ? "
102544	102579	102500	102500	Hermione	358	" It 's not my fault she 's barking mad , Hermione . Or d'you think she overheard you being rude about Filch ? I 've always thought there might be something between them ... "
102580	102586	102500	102500	Hermione	358	" Oh , ha ha .. "
102631	102633	102635	102635	Harry	136	" Baubles "
102649	102654	102656	102658	the fat lady	2094	" Same to you , "
102672	102677	102679	102680	Romilda Vane	293	" Hi , Harry ! "
102692	102697	102698	102698	Hermione	358	" Fancy a gillywater ? "
102702	102713	102716	102716	her	358	" what - did - I - tell - you ? "
102719	102723	102725	102725	Harry	136	" No thanks , "
102728	102736	102725	102725	Harry	136	" I do n't like it much . "
102737	102744	102746	102746	Romilda	293	" Well , take these anyway , "
102755	102780	102746	102746	Romilda	293	" Chocolate Cauldrons , they 've got firewhiskey in them . My gran sent them to me , but I do n't like them . "
102781	102789	102791	102791	Harry	136	" Oh-- right -- thanks a lot . "
102802	102813	102814	102814	He	136	" Er-- I ' m just going over here with ... "
102826	102830	102832	102832	Hermione	358	" Told you , "
102835	102852	102832	102832	Hermione	358	" Sooner you ask someone , sooner they 'll all leave you alone and you can -- "
102877	102884	102886	102886	Hermione	358	" Well , good night , Harry "
103186	103193	103195	103195	Luna	288	" Oh , hello , Harry , "
103197	103211	103195	103195	Luna	288	" D i d you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow ? "
103212	103224	103225	103225	He	136	" Hi , Luna . Hermione , you left your stuff ... "
103231	103236	103238	103238	Hermione	358	" Oh , yes , "
103265	103279	103281	103281	she	358	" Thank you , Harry . Well , I 'd better get going ... "
103306	103313	103315	103315	Luna	288	" She 's a bit upset , "
103317	103344	103315	103315	Luna	288	" I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there , but it turned out to be Hermione . She said something about Ron Weasley ... "
103345	103354	103356	103356	Harry	136	" Yeah , they 've had a row , "
103358	103369	103371	103371	Luna	288	" He says funny things sometimes , does n't he ? "
103381	103396	103371	103371	Luna	288	" But he can be a bit unkind . I noticed that last year . "
103397	103401	103403	103403	Harry	136	" I s'pose , "
103425	103434	103408	103408	her	288	" So have you had a good term ? "
103435	103445	103447	103447	Luna	288	" Oh , it 's been al l right , "
103449	103480	103447	103447	Luna	288	" A bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny 's been nice , though . She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me ' Loony ' the other day -- "
103481	103497	103525	103525	Luna	288	" How would you like to come to S lughorn 's party with me tonight ? "
103535	103543	103525	103525	Luna	288	" Slughorn 's party ? With you ? "
103544	103547	103549	103549	Harry	136	" Yeah , "
103551	103569	103549	103549	Harry	136	" We 're supposed to bring guests , so I thought you might like .. I mean ... "
103580	103599	103570	103570	He	136	" I mean , just as friends , you know . But if you do n't want to ... "
103612	103627	103629	103629	Luna	288	" O h no , I 'd love to go with you as friends ! "
103641	103674	103629	103629	Luna	288	" Nobody 's ever asked me to a party before , as a friend ! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow , for the party ? Should I dye mine too ? "
103675	103677	103679	103679	Harry	136	" No "
103682	103713	103679	103679	Harry	136	" That was a mistake . I 'll get Hermione to put it right for me . So I 'll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o'clock then . "
103714	103717	103629	103629	Luna	288	" AHA ! "
103756	103775	103777	103777	he	460	" Potty asked Loony to go to the part y ! Potty lurves Loony ! Potty luuuuuurves Looooony ! "
103784	103789	103777	103777	he	460	" Potty loves Loony ! "
103790	103798	103800	103800	Harry	136	" Nice to keep these things private , "
103829	103836	103838	103838	Ron	217	" You could 've taken anyone ! "
103844	103853	103838	103838	Ron	217	" Anyone ! And you chose Loony Lovegood ? "
103854	103863	103865	103865	Ginny	236	" Do n't call her that , Ron ! "
103877	103893	103895	103895	she	236	" I 'm really glad you 're taking her Harry , she 's so excited . "
103953	103959	103961	103961	Harry	136	" You could say sorry , "
103964	103976	103978	103978	Ron	217	" What , and get attacked by another flock of canaries ? "
103980	103990	103978	103978	Ron	217	" What did you have to imitate her for ? "
103991	103998	104022	104022	he	217	" She laughed at my mustache ! "
103999	104014	104022	104022	he	217	" So did I , it was the stupidest thing I 've ever seen . "
104050	104055	104057	104057	Parvati	346	" Hi , Harry , "
104076	104079	104081	104081	Harry	136	" Hi , "
104083	104105	104081	104081	Harry	136	" How 're you ? You 're staying at Hogwarts , then ? I heard your parents wanted you to leave . "
104106	104121	104123	104123	Parvati	346	" I managed to talk them out o f it for the time being , "
104125	104149	104123	104123	Parvati	346	" That Katie thing really freaked them out , but as there has n't been anything since ... Oh , hi , Hermione ! "
104193	104198	104200	104200	Hermione	358	" Hi , Parvati ! "
104208	104218	104200	104200	Hermione	358	" Are you going to Slughorn 's party tonight ? "
104219	104223	104225	104225	Parvati	346	" No invite , "
104228	104256	104225	104225	Parvati	346	" I 'd love to go , though , it sounds like it 's going to be really good ... You 're going , are n't you ? "
104257	104271	104200	104200	Hermione	358	" Yes , I 'm meeting Cormac at eight , and we 're - "
104302	104313	104294	104294	she	358	" - we 're going up to the party together . "
104314	104317	104319	104319	Parvati	346	" Cormac ? "
104321	104328	104319	104319	Parvati	346	" Cormac McLaggen , you mean ? "
104329	104334	104336	104336	Hermione	358	" That 's right , "
104339	104346	104348	104348	she	358	" The one who * almost * "
104359	104366	104348	104348	she	358	" bec a me Gryffindor Keeper . "
104367	104377	104379	104379	Parvati	346	" Are you going out with him , then ? "
104385	104395	104397	104397	Harmione	464	" Oh - yes - did n't you know ? "
104409	104412	104414	104414	Parvati	346	" No ! "
104426	104447	104414	104414	Parvati	346	" Wow , you like your Quidditch players , do n't you ? First Krum , then McLaggen . . . "
104448	104458	104461	104461	her	358	" I like * really good * Quidditch players , "
104466	104482	104483	104483	She	358	" Well , see you ... Got to go and get ready for the party ... "
104638	104641	104642	104642	he	136	" Hi , "
104645	104652	104642	104642	he	136	" Shall we get going then ? "
104653	104657	104658	104658	she	288	" Oh yes , "
104662	104668	104658	104658	she	288	" Where is the party ? "
104669	104674	104676	104676	Harry	136	" Slughorn 's office , "
104692	104706	104676	104676	Harry	136	" Did you hear , there 's supposed to be a vampire coming ? "
104707	104711	104713	104713	Luna	288	" Rufus Scrimgeour ? "
104715	104720	104722	104722	Harry	136	" I - what ? "
104726	104734	104722	104722	Harry	136	" You mean the Minister of Magic ? "
104735	104743	104745	104745	Luna	288	" Yes , he 's a vampire , "
104752	104795	104796	104796	Harry	136	" Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge , but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry . Obviously , they did n't want the truth to get out ! "
105028	105033	105035	105035	Slughorn	216	" Harry , m'boy ! "
105051	105068	105069	105069	Slughorn	216	" Come in , come in , so many people I 'd like you to meet ! "
105118	105159	105106	105106	Harry	136	" Harry , I 'd like you to meet Eldred Worple , an old student of mine , author of ' Blood Brothers : My L ife Amongst the Vampires ' - and , of course , his friend Sanguini . "
105220	105229	105231	105231	Worple	466	" Harry Potter , I am simply delighted ! "
105241	105270	105231	105231	Worple	466	" I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day , ' Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting ? ' "
105271	105274	105276	105276	Harry	136	" Er , "
105278	105282	105276	105276	Harry	136	" were you ? "
105283	105291	105293	105293	Worple	466	" Just as modest as Horace described ! "
105295	105300	105302	105302	his	466	" But seri - ously "
105311	105394	105396	105396	Worple	466	" I would be delighted to write it myself — people are craving to know more about you , dear boy , craving ! If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews , say in four- or five - hour sessions , why , we could have the book finished within months . And all with very little effort on your part , I assure you — ask Sanguini here if it is n't quite — Sanguini , stay here ! "
105422	105429	105431	105431	Worple	466	" Here , have a pasty , "
105454	105470	105448	105448	his	466	" My dear boy , the gold you could make , you have no idea — "
105471	105478	105480	105480	Harry	136	" I 'm definitely not interested , "
105483	105496	105497	105497	He	136	" and I 've just seen a friend of mine , sorry . "
105529	105534	105506	105506	he	136	" Hermione ! Hermione ! "
105535	105549	105506	105506	he	136	" Harry ! There you are , thank goodness ! Hi , Luna ! "
105550	105557	105559	105559	Harry	136	" What 's happened to you ? "
105585	105602	105603	105603	she	358	" Oh , I 've just escaped — I mean , I 've just left Cormac , "
105606	105611	105612	105612	she	358	" Under the mistletoe , "
105626	105635	105636	105636	he	136	" Serves you right for coming with him , "
105641	105650	105652	105652	Hermione	358	" I thought he 'd annoy Ron most , "
105657	105675	105652	105652	Hermione	358	" I debated for a while about Zacharias Smith , but I thought , on the whole — "
105676	105681	105683	105683	Harry	136	" You considered Smith ? "
105687	105734	105683	105683	Harry	136	" Yes , I did , and I 'm starting to wish I 'd chosen him , McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman . Let 's go this way , we 'll be able to see him coming , he 's so tall . . . . "
105771	105774	105776	105776	Luna	288	" Hello , "
105782	105789	105791	105792	Professor Trelawney	333	" Good evening , my dear , "
105808	105820	105801	105801	Harry	136	" I have n't seen you in my classes lately . .. "
105821	105831	105833	105833	Luna	288	" No , I 've got Firenze this year , "
105835	105841	105843	105844	Professor Trelawney	333	" Oh , of course , "
105852	105917	105918	105919	Professor Trelawney	333	" Or Dobbin , as I prefer to think of him . You would have thought , would you not , that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse ? But no ... we share classes . . . . It 's an insult , frankly , an insult . Do you know . . . "
105945	105966	105937	105937	Harry	136	" Let ' s get something straight . Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts ? "
105972	105983	105969	105969	her	358	" Do you really think I 'd stoop that low ? "
105990	106000	105969	105969	her	358	" Hermione , if you can ask 0111 McLaggen — "
106001	106007	106009	106009	Hermione	358	" There 's a difference , "
106013	106037	106009	106009	Hermione	358	" I 've got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might , or might not , have happened at Keeper tryouts . "
106038	106041	106043	106043	Harry	136	" Good , "
106046	106063	106043	106043	Harry	136	" Because he 'll just fall apart again , and we 'll lose the next match — "
106064	106067	106069	106069	Hermione	358	" Quidditch ! "
106072	106120	106069	106069	Hermione	358	" Is that all boys care about ? Cormac has n't asked me one single question about myself , no , I 've just been treated to ' A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen ' nonstop ever since — oh no , here he comes ! "
106152	106156	106158	106158	McLaggen	302	" Seen Hermione ? "
106170	106175	106177	106177	Harry	136	" No , sorry , "
106201	106205	106207	106208	Professor Trelawney	333	" Harry Potter ! "
106222	106227	106229	106229	Harry	136	" Oh , hello , "
106232	106237	106238	106238	she	358	" My dear boy ! "
106246	106308	106238	106238	she	358	" The rumors ! The stories ! ' The Chosen One ' ! Of course , I have known for a very long time . . . . The omens were never good , Harry . . . But why have you not returned to Divination ? For you , of all people , the subject is of the utmost importance ! "
106309	106325	106332	106332	Slughorn	216	" Ah , Sybi l l , we all think our subject 's most important ! "
106369	106386	106388	106388	Slughorn	216	" But I do n't t hink I 've ever known such a natural at Potions ! "
106403	106440	106388	106388	Slughorn	216	" Instinctive , you know — like his mother ! I 've only ever taught a few with this kind of ability , I can tell you that , Sybi l l — why even Severus — "
106464	106475	106477	106477	Slughorn	216	" Stop skulking and come and join us , Severus ! "
106480	106512	106477	106477	Slughorn	216	" I was just talking about Harry 's exceptional po - tion - making ! Some credit must go to you , of course , you taught him for five years ! "
106536	106554	106531	106531	his	156	" Funny , I never had the impression that I managed to teach Potter anything at all . "
106555	106565	106567	106567	Slughorn	216	" Well , then , it 's natural ability ! "
106569	106607	106567	106567	Slughorn	216	" You should have seen what he gave me , first lesson , Draught of Living Death — never had a student produce finer on a first attempt , I do n't think even you , Severus — "
106608	106611	106613	106613	Snape	156	" Really ? "
106649	106661	106663	106663	Slughorn	216	" Remind me what other subjects you 're taking , Harry ? "
106665	106679	106663	106663	Slughorn	216	" Defense Against the D ark Arts , Charms , Transfiguration , Herbology ... "
106680	106693	106695	106696	Snap e	474	" All the subjects required , in short , for an Auror , "
106702	106716	106718	106718	Harry	136	" Yeah , well , that 's what I 'd like to do , "
106721	106731	106733	106733	Slughorn	216	" And a great one you 'll make too ! "
106735	106748	106750	106750	Luna	288	" I do n't think you should be an Auror , Harry , "
106759	106799	106754	106754	Everybody	4716	" The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy , I thought everyone knew that . They 're planning to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a c om bination of Dark Magic and gum disease . "
106867	106871	106873	106873	Filch	476	" Professor Slughorn , "
106891	106928	106887	106887	his	476	" I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor . He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out . Did you issue him with an invitation ? "
106940	106949	106950	106950	he	170	" All right , I was n't invited ! "
106954	106964	106950	106950	he	170	" I was trying to gate crash , happy ? "
106965	106972	106974	106974	Filch	476	" No , I 'm not ! "
106988	107022	106950	106950	he	170	" You 're in trouble , you are ! Did n't the headma ster say that nighttime prowling ' s out , unless you 've got permission , did n't he , eh ? "
107023	107035	107037	107037	Slughorn	216	-=-"That 's all right , Argus , that 's all right , "
107044	107187	107037	107037	Slughorn	216	" It 's Christmas , and it 's not a crime to want to come to a party . Just this once , we 'll forget any punishment ; you may stay , Draco . Fil ich 's expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly pre di c t able ; but why , Harry wondered , watching him , did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy ? And why was Snape looking at Mal - foy as though both angry and . . . was it p ossible ? ... a lit tl afraid ? But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen , Filch had turned and shuffled away , muttering under his breath ; Malfoy h ad composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity , and Snape 's face was smoothly inscrutable again . "
107194	107205	107206	107206	I	0	" said Slughorn , waving away Malfoy 's t hanks . "
107215	107216	107217	107217	He	2419	" "
107227	107232	107217	107217	He	2419	" said Malfoy quickly . "
107247	107327	107328	107328	I	0	" Harry stared at Malfoy . It was not the sucking - up that intrigued him ; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time . It was the fact that Malfoy did , after all , look a little ill . This was the first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages ; he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin . "
107338	107343	107336	107336	Draco	170	" said Snape suddenly . "
107348	107355	107346	107346	Severus	156	" said Slughorn , hiccuping again , "
107367	107368	107369	107369	I	0	" "
107391	107396	107400	107400	Draco	170	" said Snape curtly . "
107402	107427	107400	107400	Draco	170	" They left , Snape leading the way , Malfoy looking resentful . Harry stood there for a moment , irresolute , then said , "
107442	107443	107436	107436	Luna	288	" "
107447	107622	107436	107436	Luna	288	" she said cheerfully , and he thought he heard her , as he hurried off into the crowd , resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney , who seemed sincerely in terested . It was easy , once out of the party , to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself , for the corridor was quite deserted . What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy . Harry ran down the corridor , the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn 's office behind him . Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons ... or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slyt herin common room . . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until , with a great jolt of excitement , he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices . "
107639	107640	107641	107641	I	0	" "
107654	107655	107656	107656	I	0	" "
107684	107685	107674	107674	you	170	" "
107690	107695	107674	107674	you	170	" said Malfoy angrily . "
107757	107768	107752	107752	I	0	" There was a pause and then Snape said quietly , "
107797	107798	107787	107787	you	170	" "
107818	107858	107814	107814	you	170	" Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole . . . . What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this — Snape , toward whom he had always shown respect , even liking ? "
107902	107903	107891	107891	I	0	" "
107915	107928	107929	107929	You	170	" jeered Malfoy . There was another pause . Then Snape said , "
107945	107946	107947	107947	You	170	" "
107960	107961	107947	107947	You	170	" "
107966	107990	107964	107964	me	0	" said Snape , his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear . "
108016	108017	108014	108014	Draco	170	" "
108078	108079	108082	108082	your	170	" "

108129	108130	108131	108131	You	170	" "
108159	108160	108161	108161	I	0	" "
108179	108180	108171	108171	you	170	" "
108186	108199	108171	108171	you	170	" spat Snape , for Malfoy ' s voice had risen excitedly . "
108235	108236	108229	108229	they	2434	" "
108242	108246	108229	108229	they	2434	" said Malfoy . "
108279	108280	108275	108277	the Dark Arts	250	" "
108293	108297	108291	108291	Draco	170	" said Snape . "
108352	108353	108340	108340	you	170	" "
108373	108374	108370	108371	better people	2440	" "
108386	108387	108388	108388	I	0	" "
108403	108414	108415	108415	You	170	" There was another pause , then Snape said coldly , "
108437	108543	108422	108422	I	0	" Harry had barely a second ' s warning ; he heard Malfoy 's footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open . Malfoy was striding away down the corridor , past the open door of Slughorns office , around the distant corner , and out of sight . Hardly daring to breathe , Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom . His expression unfath - omable , he returned to the party . Harry remained on the floor , hid - den beneath the cloak , his mind racing .
108551	108568	108422	108422	I	0	“ So Snape was offering to help him ? He was definitely offering to help him ? "
108569	108578	108580	108580	Harry	136	" If you ask . that once more , "
108582	108591	108580	108580	Harry	136	" I 'm going to stick this sprout — "
108592	108598	108600	108600	Ron	217	" I 'm only checking ! "
108633	108643	108645	108645	Harry	136	" Yes , Snape was offering to help him ! "
108647	108672	108645	108645	Harry	136	" He said he 'd promised Malfoy 's mother to protect him , that he 'd made an Un - breakable Oath or something — "
108673	108678	108680	108680	Ron	217	" An Unbreakable Vow ? "
108685	108700	108680	108680	Ron	217	" Nah , he ca n't have . . . . Are you sure ? "
108701	108708	108710	108710	Harry	136	" Yes , I 'm sure , "
108712	108720	108710	108710	Harry	136	" Why , what does it mean ? "
108721	108735	108680	108680	Ron	217	“ Well , you ca n't break an Unbreakable Vow . . . . "
108736	108758	108680	108680	Ron	217	" I 'd worked that much out for myself , funnily enough . What happens if you break it , then ? "
108759	108763	108765	108765	Ron	217	" You die , "
108768	108807	108809	108809	Ron	217	" Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five . I nearly did too , I was holding hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us . He went mental , "
108819	108846	108816	108816	his	217	" Only time I 've ever seen Dad as angry as Mum , Fred reckons his left but - tock has never been the same since . "
108847	108859	108816	108816	his	217	" Yeah , well , passing over Fred 's left buttock — "
108860	108866	108868	108868	Fred	232	" I beg your pardon ? "
108878	108897	108868	108868	Fred	232	" Aaah , George , look at this . They 're using knives and everything . Bless them . "
108898	108912	108914	108914	Ron	217	" I 'll be seventeen in two and a bit months ' time , "
108917	108930	108914	108914	Ron	217	" and then I 'll be able to do it by magic ! "
108931	108935	108937	108937	George	233	" But meanwhile , "
108953	108974	108937	108937	George	233	" we can enjoy watching you demon - strate the correct use of a — whoops - a - daisy ! "
108975	108982	108984	108984	Ron	217	" You made me do that ! "
108992	109001	108984	108984	Ron	217	" You wait , when I 'm seventeen — "
109002	109017	109019	109019	Fred	232	" I 'm sure you 'll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills , "
109021	109031	109033	109033	George	233	" And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills , Ronald , "
109035	109060	109033	109033	George	233	" what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called — unless our information is faulty — Lavender Brown ? "
109080	109086	109073	109073	he	217	" Mind your own business . "
109087	109093	109095	109095	Fred	232	" What a snappy retort , "
109097	109123	109095	109095	Fred	232	" I really do n't know how you think of them . No , what we wanted to know was ... how did it happen ? "
109124	109129	109073	109073	he	217	" What d'you mean ? "
109130	109139	109073	109073	he	217	" Did she have an accident or something ? "
109140	109143	109095	109095	Fred	232	" What ? "
109147	109165	109166	109167	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Well , how did she sustain such extensive brain damage ? Care - ful , now ! "
109200	109203	109204	109204	she	218	" Ron ! "
109208	109223	109204	109204	she	218	" Do n't you ever let me see you throw - ing knives again ! "
109224	109229	109231	109231	Ron	217	" I wo nt , "
109233	109238	109239	109239	he	217	" let you see , "
109254	109282	109239	109239	he	217	" Fred , George , I 'm sorry , dears , but Remus is arriving tonight , so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two . "
109284	109288	109290	109290	George	233	" No problem , "
109293	109322	109290	109290	George	233	" Then , as Charlie is n't coming home , that just leaves Harry and ; |/ Ron in the attic , and if Fleur shares with Ginny — "
109323	109332	109334	109334	Fred	232	" — that 'll make Ginny 's Christmas — "
109336	109353	109355	109356	Mrs. Weasley	218	" — everyone should be comfortable . Well , they 'll have a bed , anyway , "
109362	109373	109375	109375	Fred	232	" Percy definitely not showing his ugly face , then ? "
109385	109399	109382	109382	she	218	" No , he 's busy , I expect , at the Ministry . "
109400	109410	109412	109412	Fred	232	" Or he 's the world 's biggest prat , "
109421	109427	109412	109412	Fred	232	" One of the two . "
109439	109440	109437	109437	George	233	" "
109448	109452	109443	109443	you	2451	" asked Ron . "

109737	109738	109727	109727	I	0	" "
109752	109753	109754	109754	I	0	" "
109776	109790	109769	109769	he	4814	" There was silence for a moment or two , then Ron said , "
109835	109836	109841	109841	him	156	" "
109843	109848	109837	109837	They	2460	" said Harry flatly . "
109861	109862	109859	109859	Snape	156	" "
109885	109894	109877	109877	Harry	136	" You think I 'm right , though ? "
109896	109902	109904	109904	Ron	217	" Yeah , I do ! "
109907	109928	109904	109904	Ron	217	" Seriously , I do ! But they 're all convinced Snape 's in the Order , are n't they ? "
110158	110164	110166	110166	he	136	" I told you so , "
110408	110418	110419	110419	Fred	232	" A Cauldron Full of Hot , Strong Love , "
110513	110523	110525	110526	Mrs. Weasley	218	" We danced to this when we were eighteen ! "
110535	110542	110525	110526	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Do you remember , Arthur ? "
110543	110546	110548	110549	Mr. Weasley	220	" Mphf ? "
110563	110572	110548	110549	Mr. Weasley	220	" Oh yes ... marvelous tune . . . "
110596	110601	110602	110602	he	136	" Sorry about this , "
110618	110623	110612	110612	Celestina	483	" Be over soon . "
110624	110628	110630	110630	Harry	136	" No problem , "
110634	110643	110630	110630	Harry	136	" Has it been busy at the Ministry ? "
110644	110647	110649	110650	Mr. Weasley	220	" Very , "
110652	110698	110699	110699	he	220	" I would n't mind if we were getting anywhere , but of the three arrests we 've made in the last couple of months , I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater — only do n't repeat that , Harry , "
110712	110724	110726	110726	Harry	136	" They 're not still holding Stan Shunpike , are they ? "
110728	110734	110736	110737	Mr. Weasley	220	" I 'm afraid so , "
110739	110823	110736	110737	Mr. Weasley	220	" I know Dumbledore 's tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan . ... I mean , anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he 's about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they 're making some progress , and ' three arrests ' sounds better than ' three mistaken arrests and releases ' . . . but again , this is all top secret . . . . "
110824	110831	110833	110833	Harry	136	" I wo n't say anything , "
110865	110875	110859	110860	Celestina Warbeck	483	" You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me . "
110876	110897	110906	110907	Mr. Weasley	220	" Mr. Weasley , you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school ? "
110898	110904	110906	110907	Mr. Weasley	220	" I checked , Harry , "
110911	110937	110906	110907	Mr. Weasley	220	" I went and searched the Malfoys ' house . There was nothing , either broken or whole , that should n't have been there . "
110938	110970	110972	110972	he	220	" Yeah , I know , I saw in the Prophet that you 'd looked . . . but this is something different . . . . Well , something more ... "
111041	111050	111052	111053	Mr. Weasley	220	" Has it occurred to you , Harry , "
111055	111063	111052	111053	Mr. Weasley	220	" that Snape was simply pretending — ? "
111064	111082	111084	111084	Harry	136	" Pretending to offer help , so that he could find out what Malfoy 's up to ? "
111087	111103	111084	111084	Harry	136	" Yeah , I thought you 'd say that . But how do we know ? "
111104	111113	111115	111115	Lupin	227	" It is n't our business to know , "
111134	111157	111118	111118	He	227	" It 's Dumbledore ’s business . Dumbledore trusts Severus , and that ought to be good enough for all of us . "
111158	111161	111163	111163	Harry	136	" But , "
111165	111176	111163	111163	Harry	136	" just say — just say Dumbledores wrong about Snape — "
111177	111208	111118	111118	He	227	" People have said it , many times . It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore ’s judgment . I do ; therefore , I trust Severus . "
111209	111216	111218	111218	Harry	136	" But Dumbledore can make mistakes , "
111220	111228	111230	111230	he	136	" He says it himself . And you "
111238	111245	111230	111230	he	136	" do you honestly like Snape ? "
111246	111254	111256	111256	Lupin	227	" I neither like nor dislike Severus , "
111258	111269	111270	111270	he	227	" No , Harry , I am speaking the truth , "
111282	111359	111274	111274	Harry	136	" We shall never be bosom friends , perhaps ; after all that hap - pened between James and Sirius and Severus , there is too much bitterness there . But I do not forget that during the year I taught at Hogwarts , Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month , made it perfectly , so that I did not have to suffer as I usu - ally do at the full moon . "
111360	111381	111383	111383	Harry	136	" But he ' accidentally ' let it slip that you 're a werewolf , so you had to leave ! "
111389	111432	111386	111386	Lupin	227	" The news would have leaked out anyway . We both know he wanted my job , but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion . He kept me healthy . I must be grateful . "
111433	111448	111450	111450	Harry	136	" Maybe he did n't dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him ! "
111452	111462	111464	111464	Lupin	227	" You are determined to hate him , Harry , "
111470	111549	111464	111464	Lupin	227	" And I understand ; with James as your father , with Sir - ius as your godfather , you have inherited an old prejudice . By all means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me , but do not expect him to share your view of the matter ; do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him . It might have been on Dumbledore 's orders that Severus questioned Draco . "
111602	111607	111609	111609	Fleur	238	" Eez eet over ? "
111612	111621	111609	111609	Fleur	238	" Thank goodness , what an ' orrible — "
111622	111631	111633	111634	Mr. Weasley	220	" Shall we have a nightcap , then ? "
111642	111647	111639	111639	his	220	" Who wants eggnog ? "
111648	111657	111658	111658	Harry	136	" What have you been up to lately ? "
111682	111690	111692	111692	Lupin	227	" Oh , I 've been underground , "
111694	111723	111692	111692	Lupin	227	" Almost literally . That 's why I have n't been able to write , Harry ; sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway . "
111726	111732	111692	111692	Lupin	227	" What do you mean ? "
111734	111746	111748	111748	Lupin	227	" I 've been living among my fellows , my equals , "
111750	111753	111754	111754	he	227	" Werewolves , "
111763	111789	111790	111790	He	227	" Nearly all of them are on Voldemort 's side . Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was . . . ready - made . "
111811	111877	111802	111802	he	227	" I am not complaining ; it is necessary work and who can do it better than I ? However , it has been difficult gaining their trust . I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards , you see , whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins , stealing — and sometimes killing — to eat . "
111878	111885	111807	111807	he	227	" How come they like Voldemort ? "
111886	111902	111904	111904	Lupin	227	" They think that , under his rule , they will have a better life , "
111906	111921	111904	111904	Lupin	227	" And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there . . . . "
111922	111927	111807	111807	he	227	" Who 's Greyback ? "
111928	111936	111904	111904	Lupin	227	" You have n't heard of him ? "
111946	112058	112059	112059	Lupin	227	" Fenrir Greyback is , perhaps , the most savage werewolf alive today . He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to conta - minate as many people as possible ; he wants to create enough were - wolves to overcome the wizards . Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services . Greyback specializes in children . . . . Bite them young , he says , and raise them away from their parents , raise them to hate normal wizards . Voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon people 's sons and daughters ; it is a threat that usually produces good results . "
112065	112073	112059	112059	Lupin	227	" It was Greyback who bit me . "
112074	112077	112079	112079	Harry	136	" What ? "
112083	112095	112079	112079	Harry	136	" When — when you were a kid , you mean ? "
112096	112233	112059	112059	Lupin	227	" Yes . My father had offended him . I did not know , for a very long time , the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me ; I even felt pity for him , thinking that he had had no control , know - ing by then how it felt to transform . But Greyback is not like that . At the full moon , he positions himself close to victims , ensuring that he is near enough to strike . He plans it all . And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves . I can not pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against Greyback 's insistence that we werewolves deserve blood , that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people . "
112234	112240	112242	112242	Harry	136	" But you are normal ! "
112245	112255	112242	112242	Harry	136	" You 've just got a — a problem — "
112261	112296	112297	112297	He	227	" Sometimes you remind me a lot of James . He called it my ' furry little problem in company . Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit . "
112351	112365	112340	112340	he	136	" Have you ever heard of someone called the Half - Blood Prince ? "
112366	112373	112400	112400	Lupin	227	" The Half - Blood what ? "
112374	112377	112379	112379	Harry	136	" Prince , "
112391	112398	112400	112400	Lupin	227	" There are no Wizarding princes , "
112405	112432	112400	112400	Lupin	227	" Is this a title you re thinking of adopting ? I should have thought be - ing ' the Chosen One ' would be enough . "
112433	112442	112444	112444	Harry	136	" It 's nothing to do with me ! "
112447	112487	112444	112444	Harry	136	" The Half - Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts , I 've got his old Potions book . He wrote spells all over it , spells he invented . One of them was Levicorpus — "
112488	112503	112505	112505	Lupin	227	" Oh , that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts , "
112508	112533	112505	112505	Lupin	227	" There were a few months in my fifth year when you could n't move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle . "
112534	112540	112542	112542	Harry	136	" My dad used it , "
112544	112558	112542	112542	Harry	136	" I saw him in the Pensieve , he used it on Snape . "
112599	112602	112603	112603	he	136	" Yes , "
112606	112639	112603	112603	he	136	" but he was n't the only one . As I say , it was very popular . . . . You know how these spells come and go . , . . "
112640	112654	112655	112655	Harry	136	" But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school , "
112658	112662	112664	112664	Lupin	227	" Not necessarily , "
112666	112678	112679	112679	He	227	" Jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else . "
112690	112714	112679	112679	He	227	" James was a pureblood , Harry , and I promise you , he never asked us to call him ' Prince . ' "
112721	112731	112718	112718	Harry	136	" And it was n't Sirius ? Or you ? "
112732	112736	112679	112679	He	227	" Definitely not . "
112737	112740	112741	112741	Harry	136	" Oh . "
112747	112769	112741	112741	Harry	136	" I just thought — well , he 's helped me out a lot in Potions classes , the Prince has . "
112770	112779	112679	112679	He	227	" How old is this book , Harry ? "
112780	112789	112679	112679	He	227	" I dunno , I 've never checked . "
112790	112809	112811	112811	Lupin	227	" Well , perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at Hogwarts , "
112823	112833	112679	112679	He	227	" A Cauldron Full of Hot , Strong Love , "
113021	113032	113033	113033	Harry	136	" She 's got to be joking . . . . "
113096	113101	113103	113103	Harry	136	" What 's chat ? "
113106	113111	113113	113113	Ron	217	" Its from Lavender , "
113117	113126	113127	113127	Harry	136	" She earn honestly think I 'd wear ... "
113152	113155	113139	113139	Dan	488	“ My sweetheart ”
113156	113159	113160	113160	he	217	" Nice , "
113163	113178	113139	113139	Dan	488	" Classy . You should definitely wear it in front ol Fred and George . "
113179	113185	113187	113187	Ron	217	" If you tell them , "
113199	113207	113187	113187	Ron	217	" I — I — I ’ll — "
113208	113213	113215	113215	Harry	136	" Stutter at me ? "
113219	113226	113215	113215	Harry	136	" Come on , would I ? "
113227	113241	113242	113242	Ron	217	" How could she think I 'd like something like that , though ? "
113252	113258	113260	113260	Harry	136	" Well , think back , "
113262	113289	113260	113260	Harry	136	" Have you ever let it slip that you 'd like to go out in public with the words ' My Sweetheart ' round your neck ? "
113290	113300	113302	113302	Ron	217	" Well ... we do n't really talk much , "
113304	113311	113302	113302	Ron	217	" It 's mainly . . . "
113312	113315	113317	113317	Harry	136	" Snogging , "
113319	113324	113326	113326	Ron	217	" Well , yeah , "
113336	113345	113328	113328	He	217	" Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen ? "
113346	113350	113352	113352	Harry	136	" I dunno , "
113354	113373	113374	113374	Ron	217	" They were at Slughorn 's party together , but I do n't think it went that well . "
113450	113459	113460	113460	he	136	" D'you reckon this is safe to open ? "
113463	113481	113483	113483	Ron	217	" Ca n't be anything dangerous , all our mail 's still being searched at the Ministry , "
113493	113514	113516	113516	Harry	136	" I did n't think of giving Kreacher anything . Do people usually give their house - elves Christmas presents ? "
113523	113527	113529	113529	Ron	217	" Hermione would , "
113531	113547	113529	113529	Ron	217	" But let 's wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty . "
113575	113578	113580	113580	Ron	217	" Nice , "
113586	113590	113580	113580	Ron	217	" Very thoughtful . "
113591	113601	113603	113603	Harry	136	" I 'd rather have them than that necklace , "
113679	113693	113648	113648	herself	218	" Fred and George gave them to me ! Are n't they beautiful ? "
113696	113718	113720	113720	George	233	" Well , we find we appreciate you more and more , Mum , now we 're washing our own socks , "
113727	113732	113720	113720	George	233	" Parsnips , Remus ? "
113733	113745	113747	113747	Ginny	236	" Harry , you 've got a maggot in your hair , "
113776	113782	113784	113784	Fleur	238	" ' Ow ' orrible , "
113792	113799	113801	113801	Ron	217	" Yes , is n't it ? "
113803	113808	113801	113801	Ron	217	" Gravy , Fleur ? "
113843	113852	113854	113854	Fleur	238	" You are as bad as zat Tonks , "
113867	113873	113854	113854	Fleur	238	" She is always knocking — "
113874	113884	113886	113887	Mrs. Weasley	218	" I invited dear Tonks to come along today , "
113901	113917	113886	113887	Mrs. Weasley	218	" But she would n't come . Have you spoken to her lately , Remus ? "
113918	113932	113934	113934	Lupin	227	" No , I have n't been in contact with anybody very much , "
113936	113952	113934	113934	Lupin	227	" But Tonks has got her own family to go to , has n't she ? "
113953	113956	113958	113959	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Hmmm , "
113961	113978	113979	113979	She	238	" Maybe . I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone , actually . "
114073	114082	114083	114083	he	227	" Tonks 's Patronus has changed its form , "
114087	114107	114083	114083	he	227	" Snape said so anyway . I did n't know that could happen . Why would your Patronus change ? "
114121	114134	114108	114108	Lupin	227	" Sometimes ... a great shock ... an emotional up - heaval ... "
114135	114146	114148	114148	Harry	136	" It looked big , and it had four legs , "
114162	114171	114159	114159	his	136	" Hey ... it could n't be — ? "
114172	114175	114177	114178	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Arthur ! "
114205	114212	114196	114196	she	218	" Arthur — it 's Percy ! "
114213	114216	114217	114218	Mr. Weasley	220	" What ? "
114270	114282	114262	114262	He	245	" Arthur , he 's — he 's with the Minister ! "
114366	114372	114361	114361	Percy	245	" Merry Christmas , Mother . "
114373	114378	114380	114381	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Oh , Percy ! "
114414	114421	114422	114422	he	148	" You must forgive this intrusion , "
114439	114467	114426	114427	Mrs. Weasley	218	" Percy and I were in the vicinity — working , you know — and he could n't re - sist dropping in and seeing you all . "
114520	114531	114537	114537	her	218	" Please , come in , sit down , Minister ! "
114555	114556	114537	114537	her	218	" "
114565	114585	114563	114563	Molly	223	" said Scrimgeour . Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house . "
114614	114615	114600	114600	Percy	245	" "
114620	114632	114600	114600	Percy	245	" said Mrs. Weasley tearfully , reaching up to kiss him . "
114708	114771	114701	114701	he	2510	" The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly . Every - body looked from Scrimgeour to Harry . Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour 's pretense that he did not know Harry 's name convincing , or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny , Fleur , and George also had clean plates . "
114777	114832	114701	114701	he	2510	" said Harry into the silence . He was not fooled ; for all Scrimgeour 's talk that they had just been in the area , that Percy wanted to look up his family , this must be the real reason that they had come , so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone . "
114837	114855	114701	114701	he	2510	" he said quietly , as he passed Lupin , who had half risen from his chair . "
114858	114871	114701	114701	he	2510	" he added , as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth to speak . "
114874	114891	114892	114892	We	2511	" said Scrimgeour , standing back to let Harry pass through the door ahead of him . "
114915	114970	114913	114913	everyone	4750	" Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys ' overgrown , snow - covered garden , Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side . He had , Harry knew , been Head of the Auror office ; he looked tough and battle - scarred , very different from portly Fudge in his bowler hat . "
114973	114994	114913	114913	everyone	4750	" said Scrimgeour , stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants . "
114997	115011	115012	115012	I	0	" Harry said nothing . He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching him . "
115024	115033	115012	115012	I	0	" said Scrimgeour , after a few moments . "
115039	115040	115035	115035	you	2514	" "
115043	115051	115035	115035	you	2514	" said Harry truthfully . | ! . "
115070	115074	115062	115062	Dumbledore	146	" said Scrimgeour . "
115100	115122	115123	115123	I	0	" : He waited for Harry to say something , but Harry did not oblige , : so he went on , "
115156	115165	115141	115141	Dumbledore	146	" Still , Harry said nothing , waiting . "
115173	115177	115141	115141	Dumbledore	146	" said Scrimgeour . "
115212	115231	115232	115232	I	0	" They were getting near it now , Harry thought , the reason Scrim - geour was here . “
115243	115311	115235	115235	Dumbledore	146	" , Harry deliberated , wondering whether he ought to lie or not . He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds , ami the scuffed - up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree . Finally , he decided on the truth ... or a bit of it . "
115319	115320	115235	115235	Dumbledore	146	" "
115329	115375	115325	115325	you	2514	" said Scrimgeour . Harry could see , out of the corner of his eye , Scrimgeour squinting at him , so he pre - tended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron . "
115385	115386	115379	115379	Dumbledore	146	" "
115395	115424	115379	115379	Dumbledore	146	" said Harry . He kept his voice as pleasant as he could , and Scrimgeour 's tone , too , was light and friendly as he said , "
115472	115489	115490	115490	I	0	" Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before re - sponding . "
115501	115502	115499	115499	Minister	143	" "
115515	115524	115499	115499	Minister	143	" said Scrim - geour with a laugh . "
115553	115604	115605	115605	People	681	" Harry said nothing . He thought he saw , dimly , where they were heading , but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there . The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots , and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it . "
115618	115624	115615	115615	you	2514	" said Scrim - geour . "
115669	115680	115629	115630	the hero	2522	" he pressed on , without waiting for a reply , "
115776	115824	115825	115827	Funny little chaps	2528	" The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm . It was now tugging very hard on it , trying to get it out of the frozen ground . Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said , looking from Harry to the gnome , "
115840	115841	115836	115836	you	136	" "
115851	115857	115848	115848	you	0	" said Harry slowly . ' "
115871	115872	115848	115848	you	0	" "
115886	115892	115882	115882	I	0	" said Scrim - geour . "
115978	116002	116022	116022	you	2514	" Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach : So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry , was she ? "
116006	116021	116022	116022	you	2514	" he said , as though he just wanted to clarify a few points , "
116037	116038	116022	116022	you	2514	" "
116054	116070	116072	116074	The Chosen One	940	" said Scrimgeour , sounding relieved that Harry had cot - toned on so quickly . "
116101	116102	116072	116074	The Chosen One	940	" "
116115	116127	116105	116105	I	0	" said Harry , still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly , "
116144	116145	116134	116134	I	0	" "
116148	116155	116134	116134	I	0	" said Scrimgeour , frowning slightly , "
116168	116169	116164	116164	we	2540	" "
116180	116185	116172	116172	I	0	" said Harry pleasantly . "
116210	116226	116227	116227	I	0	" Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hard - ened instantly . "
116235	116257	116288	116288	he	146	" he said , and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been . "
116277	116278	116271	116271	You	2514	" "
116299	116303	116288	116288	he	146	" said Harry . "
116321	116342	116343	116343	I	0	" They looked at each other , long and hard . Finally Scrimgeour said , with no pretense at warmth , "
116362	116363	116364	116364	I	0	" "
116372	116376	116364	116364	I	0	" said Harry . "
116391	116392	116377	116377	Some	954	" "
116417	116426	116427	116427	You	2514	" said Harry , his temper rising now . "
116496	116499	116505	116507	the Chosen One	940	" ' i "
116510	116515	116501	116501	you	2514	" said Scrimgeour . ' "
116527	116536	116518	116518	you	2514	" said Harry , with a bitter laugh . "
116542	116543	116544	116544	I	0	" "
116551	116556	116544	116544	I	0	" said Scrimgeour quickly . "
116561	116562	116544	116544	I	0	" "
116569	116573	116580	116580	you	2514	" said Harry . "
116621	116662	116619	116619	Minister	5042	" He raised his right fist . There , shining white on the back of his cold hand , were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh : I must not tell lies . "
116695	116736	116691	116691	pals	2560	" They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet . The gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily , leaning against the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush . "
116743	116748	116739	116739	Dumbledore	146	" said Scrimgeour brusquely . "
116760	116761	116739	116739	Dumbledore	146	" "
116765	116769	116739	116739	Dumbledore	146	" said Harry . "
116780	116784	116786	116786	you	2514	" said Scrimgeour , "
116788	116789	116786	116786	you	2514	" "
116796	116800	116786	116786	you	2514	" said Harry . "
116820	116821	116822	116822	You	2514	" "
116826	116831	116822	116822	You	2514	" said Harry indifferently . "
116887	116894	116885	116885	you	2514	" There was a long pause . "
116913	116929	116903	116903	he	146	" said Scrimgeour , his eyes cold and hard behind his wire - rimmed glasses , "
116943	116944	116941	116941	Potter	136	" "
116950	116954	116947	116947	I	0	" said Harry . "
116961	116978	116947	116947	I	0	" And turning his back on the Minister of Magic , he strode back toward the house .
117127	117134	117136	117136	Ginny	236	" Do n't cry , Mum , "
117151	117157	117144	117145	Mrs. Weasley	218	" It 's okay . ... "
117158	117167	117169	117169	Ron	217	" Yeah , do n't worry about us , "
117184	117205	117169	117169	Ron	217	" or about Percy . He 's such a prat , it 's not really a loss , is it ? "
117220	117236	117213	117213	she	218	" Promise me you 'll look after yourself .. .. Stay out of trouble . ... "
117237	117245	117247	117247	Harry	136	" I always do , Mrs. Weasley , "
117249	117260	117247	117247	Harry	136	" I like a quiet life , you know me . "
117270	117281	117261	117261	She	218	" Be good , then , all of you . ... "
117290	117293	117282	117282	Harry	136	" Hogwarts ! "
117377	117393	117362	117362	She	218	" Evening , Potter . Try not to get too much ash on the carpet . "
117394	117399	117400	117400	Harry	136	" No , Professor . "
117482	117485	117487	117487	Ron	217	" Baubles , "
117511	117514	117515	117515	she	493	" No , "
117518	117527	117515	117515	she	493	“ What d’you mean , ‘ no ’ ? "
117534	117538	117515	117515	she	493	" she said . "
117545	117546	117507	117507	his	217	" "
117560	117561	117562	117562	Harry	136	" "
117566	117587	117564	117564	Ginny	236	" Hermione was hurrying toward them , very pink - faced and wearing a cloak , hat , and gloves . "
117612	117617	117606	117606	Buck	340	" she said breathlessly . "
117625	117626	117619	117619	you	136	" "
117629	117635	117619	117619	you	136	" said Ron at once , "
117642	117644	117639	117640	Rufus Scrim	490	" ] "
117654	117672	117652	117652	Harry	136	" said Hermione , neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him . "
117682	117683	117652	117652	Harry	136	" "
117686	117705	117652	117652	Harry	136	" said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice , and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole . "
117712	117716	117710	117710	her	2577	" asked Harry . "
117723	117741	117742	117742	She	2577	" said Hermione , rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room . "
117768	117792	117742	117742	She	2577	" She rummaged in her pocket for a moment , then pulled out a scroll of parchment with Dumbledore 's writing on it . "
117795	117818	117742	117742	She	2577	" said Harry , unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night . "
117835	117846	117898	117898	I	0	" But at that moment there was a loud squeal of "
117851	117880	117898	117898	I	0	" and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into Ron 's arms . Several onlookers sniggered ; Hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said , "
117892	117893	117890	117890	Ginny	236	" "
117905	117946	117898	117898	I	0	" said Ginny , though Harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic . Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling , match , Harry led Hermione over to the spare table . "
117953	117954	117898	117898	I	0	" "
117959	117963	117898	117898	I	0	" she shrugged . "
117976	117977	117978	117978	I	0	" "
117986	117990	117978	117978	I	0	" said Harry . "
117999	118000	117997	117997	you	2583	" "
118007	118012	118003	118003	I	0	" she said flatly . "
118019	118020	118021	118021	I	0	" "
118031	118032	118021	118021	I	0	" "
118069	118116	118063	118063	you	2583	" She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment , so Harry dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape . When he had finished , Hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said , "
118123	118124	118126	118126	he	2584	" "
118146	118147	118126	118126	he	2584	" "
118152	118156	118126	118126	he	2584	" said Hermione . "
118165	118170	118161	118161	Lupin	227	" Harry said grudgingly . "
118186	118187	118180	118180	you	136	" "
118194	118199	118190	118190	I	0	" she answered slowly . "
118214	118215	118211	118211	I	0	" "
118229	118237	118222	118222	them	2586	" Harry frowned , trying to remember . "
118258	118259	118243	118243	Snape	156	" "
118265	118273	118243	118243	Snape	156	" said Hermione , biting her lip . "
118278	118297	118243	118243	Snape	156	" She stared across the room , apparently lost in thought , not even noticing Lavender tickling Ron . "
118302	118303	118243	118243	Snape	156	" "
118307	118330	118243	118243	Snape	156	" said Harry , and he told her all about Lupin ’s mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing . "
118339	118340	118335	118337	this Fenrir Greyback	283	" "
118346	118353	118343	118343	I	0	" said Hermione , sounding startled . "
118361	118362	118357	118357	you	0	" "
118377	118378	118373	118373	I	0	" "
118394	118398	118388	118388	Malfoy	170	" said Hermione . "
118431	118437	118421	118421	he	170	" Harry gaped at her . "
118466	118467	118453	118453	he	170	" "
118473	118477	118453	118453	he	170	" breathed Hermione . "
118482	118483	118453	118453	he	170	" "
118489	118495	118496	118496	you	0	" said Harry in exasperation , "
118504	118505	118496	118496	you	0	" "
118520	118521	118496	118496	you	0	" "
118529	118537	118526	118526	you	0	" said Harry , shaking his head . "
118578	118769	118570	118571	Rufus Scrimgeour	148	" And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic , for Hermione , like Ron , thought that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year , they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now . The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years : a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight . APPARITION LESSONS If you are seventeen years of age , or will turn seventeen on or before the 31st August next , you are eligible for a twelve - week course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor . Please sign below if you would like to participate . Cost : 12 Galleons . Harry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom . Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up behind him , slipped her hands over his eyes , and trilled , "
118777	118843	118570	118571	Rufus Scrimgeour	148	" Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off ; he caught up with her , having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender , but to his surprise , Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole , his ears bright red and his expression disgruntled . Without a word , Hermione sped up to walk with Neville . "
118848	118869	118570	118571	Rufus Scrimgeour	148	" said Ron , his tone making it perfectly plain that Harry was not to mention what had just happened . "
118877	118878	118879	118879	I	0	" "
118882	118886	118879	118879	I	0	" said Harry . "
118912	118913	118904	118904	Dumbledore	146	" "
118932	118939	118940	118940	Fred	232	" said Ron , looking anxious . "
118945	118946	118942	118942	George	233	" "
118956	118957	118954	118954	he	256	" "
118966	118983	118987	118987	George	233	" — Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla — "
119006	119007	118987	118987	George	233	" "
119016	119017	118987	118987	George	233	" "
119031	119032	118987	118987	George	233	" "
119053	119054	119036	119036	you	0	" "
119072	119118	119062	119062	Everyone	4750	" Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition . All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming , lessons ; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will . "
119129	119138	119139	119139	Me	0	" Seamus clicked his ringers to indicate disappearance . "
119171	119229	119230	119230	Harry	136	" Lost in visions of this happy prospect , he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically , so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of today 's Charms lesson , he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face . "
119235	119261	119230	119230	Harry	136	" Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus , after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus lines : "
119274	119275	119280	119280	someone	5066	" "
119293	119294	119280	119280	someone	5066	" "
119297	119535	119280	119280	someone	5066	" whispered Seamus , and he , Dean , and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like . For the rest of the day , Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of Apparition . All of them seemed awed , rather than put off , when he told them how uncomfortable it was , and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening , when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library , so as to escape in time for his lesson with Dumbledore . The lamps in Dumbledore ’s office were lit , the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames , and the Pen - sieve was ready upon the desk once more . Dumbledore ’s hands lay on either side of it , the right one as blackened and burnt - looking as ever . It did not seem to have healed at all and Harry wondered , for perhaps the hundredth time , what had caused such a distinctive injury , but did not ask ; Dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was , in any case , another subject he wanted to discuss . But before Harry could say anything about Snape and Malfoy , Dumbledore spoke . "
119548	119549	119541	119544	the Minister of Magic	710	" "
119552	119556	119557	119557	He	710	" said Harry . "
119565	119566	119557	119557	He	710	" "
119569	119573	119557	119557	He	710	" sighed Dumbledore . "
119599	119603	119604	119604	He	710	" Harry grinned . "
119625	119670	119622	119622	Dumbledore	146	" It was Fudge 's idea originally , you know . During his last days in office , when he was trying desperately to cling to his post , he sought a meeting with you , hoping that you would give him your support — "
119671	119679	119681	119681	Harry	136	" After everything Fudge did last year ? "
119684	119688	119681	119681	Harry	136	" After Umbridge ? ”
119689	119731	119622	119622	Dumbledore	146	" I told Cornelius there was no chance of it , but the idea did not die when he left : office . Within hours of Scrimgeour 's appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you — "
119732	119740	119741	119741	Harry	136	" So that 's why you argued ! "
119745	119752	119741	119741	Harry	136	" It was in the Daily Prophet "
119754	119765	119767	119767	Dumbledore	146	" The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally , "
119769	119797	119767	119767	Dumbledore	146	" if only accidentally . Yes , that was why we argued . Well , it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last . "
119798	119813	119741	119741	Harry	136	" He accused me of being ' Dumbledore 's man through and through . ' "
119814	119821	119767	119767	Dumbledore	146	" How very rude of him . "
119822	119829	119830	119830	Dumbledore	146	" I told him I was . "
119897	119905	119891	119891	his	146	" I am very touched , Harry . "
119906	119921	119923	119923	Harry	136	" Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you 're not at Hogwarts , "
119932	119942	119944	119944	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , he is very nosy about that , "
119960	120005	119944	119944	Dumbledore	146	" He has even attempted to have me followed . Amusing , really . He set Dawlish to tail me . It was n't kind . I have already been forced to jinx Dawlish once ; I did it again with the greatest regret . "
120006	120017	120019	120019	Harry	136	" So they still do n't know where you go ? "
120044	120079	120031	120031	Dumbledore	146	" No , they do n't , and the time is not quite right for you to know either . Now , I suggest we press on , unless there 's anything else — ? "
120080	120088	120090	120090	Harry	136	" There is , actually , sir , "
120092	120100	120090	120090	Harry	136	" It 's about Malfoy and Snape . "
120101	120107	120031	120031	Dumbledore	146	" Professor Snape , Harry . "
120108	120132	120133	120133	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , sir . I overheard them during Professor Slughorns party . . . well , I followed them , actually . ... "
120160	120193	120148	120148	he	136	" Thank you for telling me this , Harry , but I suggest that you put it out of your mind . I do not think that it is of great importance . "
120194	120200	120202	120202	Harry	136	" Not of great importance ? "
120205	120213	120202	120202	Harry	136	" Professor , did you understand — ? "
120214	120234	120236	120236	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , Harry , blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower , I understood everything you told me , "
120242	120290	120236	120236	Dumbledore	146	" I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did . Again , I am glad that you have con - lided in me , but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet . "
120356	120361	120363	120363	Harry	136	" So , sir , "
120376	120383	120363	120363	Harry	136	" you definitely still trust — ? "
120384	120396	120398	120398	Dumbledore	146	" I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already , "
120409	120416	120401	120401	he	146	" My answer has not changed . "
120417	120423	120441	120441	him	417	" I should think not , "
120443	120469	120439	120439	Dumbledore	146	" And now , Harry , I must insist that we press on . I have more important things to discuss with you this evening . "
120514	120554	120511	120511	his	146	" Ah , Harry , how often this happens , even between the best of friends ! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute ! "
120555	120571	120573	120573	Harry	136	" I do n't think what you 've got to say is unimportant , sir , "
120576	120589	120591	120591	Dumbledore	146	" Well , you are quite right , because it is not , "
120594	120629	120591	120591	Dumbledore	146	" I have two more memories to show you this evening , both obtained with enormous difficulty , and the second of them is , 1 think , the most important I have collected . "
120663	120666	120668	120668	Dumbledore	146	" So , "
120675	120748	120668	120668	Dumbledore	146	" we meet this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle , whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts . You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard , that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley , and that I , in turn , warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school . "
120802	120826	120785	120785	He	379	" continued Dumbledore , waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sat , ancient and unmoving . "
120869	120957	120785	120785	He	379	" However , if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their common room , no hint of it reached the staff . He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all . As an unusually talented and very good - looking orphan , he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival . He seemed police , quiet , and thirsty for knowledge . Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him . "
120958	120980	120982	120982	Harry	136	" Did n't you tell them , sir , what he 'd been like when you met him at the orphanage ? "
120984	121031	121032	121032	Dumbledore	146	" No , I did not . Though he had shown no hint of remorse , it was possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf . I chose to give him that chance . "
121080	121126	121032	121032	Dumbledore	146	" But you did n't really trust him , sir , did you ? He told me . . . the Riddle who came out of that diary said , ' Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did . ' "
121127	121144	121146	121146	Dumbledore	146	" Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy , "
121148	121275	121146	121146	Dumbledore	146	" I had , as I have already indicated , resolved to keep a close eye upon him , and so I did . I can not pretend that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first . He was very guarded with me ; he felt , I am sure , that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much . He was careful never to reveal as much again , but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement , nor what Mrs. Cole had confided in me . However , he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues . "
121399	121474	121475	121475	I	0	" Rigidly controlled by Riddle , they were never detected in open wrongdoing , although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked , the most serious of which was , of course , the opening of the Chamber of Secrets , which resulted in the death of a girl . As you know , Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime . "
121489	121501	121485	121485	Riddle	379	" said Dumbledore , placing his withered hand on the Pensieve . "
121560	121723	121725	121725	he	2629	" Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parentage . This is understandable , of course ; he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there . It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room , on the lists of prefects in the old school records , even in the books of Wizarding history . Finally he was forced to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts . I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever , assumed the identity of Lord Volde - mort , and began his investigations into his previously despised mother 's family — the woman whom , you will remember , he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death . "
121815	121839	121840	121840	I	0	" : Dumbledore rose , and Harry saw that he was again holding a. small crystal bottle filled with swirling , pearly memory . "
121848	121862	121840	121840	I	0	" he said , as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve . "
121876	122152	122153	122153	YOU	2637	" Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory ; he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness . It took him several seconds to recognize the place , by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him . The Gaunts ' house was now more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen . The ceiling was thick with cobwebs , the floor coated in grime ; moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots . The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth . He was slumped in an armchair by the fire , and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead . But then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake , raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left . The door creaked open . There on the threshold , holding an old - fashioned lamp , stood a boy Harry recognized at once : tall , pale , dark - haired , and handsome — the teenage Voldemort . Voldemort 's eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair . For a few seconds they looked at each other , then the man staggered upright , the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor . "
122155	122159	122160	122160	YOU	2637	" he bellowed . "
122162	122176	122160	122160	YOU	2637	" And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle , wand and knife held aloft . "
122179	122221	122222	122222	You	2637	" Riddle spoke in Parseltongue . The man skidded into the table , sending moldy pots crashing to the floor . He stared at Riddle . There was a long silence while they contemplated each other . The man broke it . "
122226	122227	122222	122222	You	2637	" "
122234	122282	122230	122230	I	0	" said Riddle . He moved forward into the room , allowing the door to swing shut behind him . Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort 's complete lack of fear . His race merely expressed disgust and , perhaps , disappointment . "
122287	122291	122285	122285	Marvolo	379	" he asked . "
122294	122299	122285	122285	Marvolo	379	" said the other . "
122308	122312	122306	122306	he	379	" Riddle frowned . "
122319	122320	122315	122315	you	2637	" "
122329	122330	122327	122327	I	0	" "
122335	122336	122331	122333	Marvolo 's son	2638	" "
122344	122382	122383	122383	I	0	" ? , , . Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face , the better to see Riddle , and Harry saw that he wore Marvolo 's black - stoned ring on his right hand . "
122390	122394	122387	122388	that Muggle	1817	" whispered Morfin . "
122402	122403	122399	122400	that Muggle	1817	" "
122407	122412	122405	122405	Muggle	206	" said Riddle sharply . "
122435	122449	122423	122424	that Muggle	1817	" said Morfin , and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them . "
122480	122500	122501	122501	He	1817	" Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little , still clutching the edge of the table for support . "
122507	122532	122501	122501	He	1817	" he added stupidly . Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities . Now he moved a little closer and said , "
122537	122538	122539	122539	Ar	374	" "
122553	122563	122541	122541	he	1817	" said Morfin , spitting on the floor again . "
122588	122610	122584	122584	Slytherin	434	" Voldemort did not answer . Morfin was working himself into a rage again ; he brandished his knife and shouted , "
122649	122726	122615	122615	she	374	" He looked away , staggering slightly , and Voldemort moved forward . As he did so , an unnatural darkness fell , extinguishing Voldemort 's lamp and Morfin 's candle , extinguishing everything . . . . Dumbledore 's fingers closed tightly around Harry 's arm and they were soaring back into the present again . The soft golden light in Dumbledore 's office seemed to dazzle Harry 's eyes after that impenetrable darkness . | "
122731	122737	122615	122615	she	374	" said Harry at once . "
122747	122748	122615	122615	she	374	" "
122760	122771	122750	122750	Morfin	206	" said Dumbledore , gesturing Harry back into his seat . "
122794	122838	122788	122788	Marvolo	379	" Meanwhile , in the village of Little Hangleton , a maid was running along the High Street , screaming that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house : Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and father . "
122887	122899	122885	122885	me	0	" Dumbledore added , with a nod to Harry 's scar . "
122955	123145	122923	122927	a convicted Muggle - hater	2652	" So the Ministry called upon Morfin . They did not need to question him , to use Veritaserum or Legilimency . He admitted to the murder on the spot , giving details only the murderer could know . He was proud , he said , to have killed the Muggles , had been awaiting his chance all these years . He handed over his wand , which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles . And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight . All that disturbed him was the fact that his fathers ring had disappeared . ' He 'll kill me for losing it , ' he told his captors over and over again . ' He 'll kill me for losing his ring . ' And that , apparently , was all he ever said again . He lived out the remainder of his life in Azkaban , lamenting the loss of Marvolo 's last heirloom , and is buried beside the prison , alongside the other poor souls who have expired within its walls . "
123146	123157	123159	123159	Harry	136	" So Voldemort stole Morfin 's wand and used it ? "
123165	123170	123172	123172	Dumbledore	146	" That 's right , "
123174	123307	123172	123172	Dumbledore	146	" We have no memories to show us this , but I think we can be fairly sure what happened . Voldemort Stupefied his uncle , took his wand , and proceeded across the valley to ' the big house over the way . ' There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother , and , for good measure , his Muggle grandparents , thus obliterating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him . Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel , performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle 's mind , laid Morfin 's wand beside its unconscious owner , pocketed the ancient ring he wore , and departed . "
123308	123319	122923	122927	a convicted Muggle - hater	2652	" And Morfin never realized he had n't done it ? "
123320	123323	123325	123325	Dumbledore	146	" Never , "
123327	123341	123325	123325	Dumbledore	146	" He gave , as I say , a full and boastful confession . "
123342	123355	122923	122927	a convicted Muggle - hater	2652	" But he had this real memory in him all the time ! "
123356	123375	123377	123377	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him , "
123379	123476	123377	123377	Dumbledore	146	" and why should anybody delve further into Morfin 's mind when he had already confessed to the crime ? However , I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of his life , by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I could about Voldemort 's past . I extracted this memory with difficulty . When I saw what it contained , I attempted to use it to secure Morfin 's release from Azkaban . Before the Ministry reached their decision , however , Morfin had died . "
123477	123495	123496	123496	Harry	136	" But how come the Ministry did n't realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin ? "
123499	123519	122923	122927	a convicted Muggle - hater	2652	" He was underage at the time , was n't he ? I thought they could detect underage magic ! "
123520	123559	123377	123377	Dumbledore	146	" You are quite right — they can detect magic , but not the perpetrator : You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was , in fact , cast by — "
123560	123563	123565	123565	Harry	136	" Dobby , "
123572	123597	123377	123377	Dumbledore	146	" So if you 're underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard 's house , the Ministry wo n't know ? "
123598	123611	123613	123613	Dumbledore	146	" They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic , "

123671	123675	123677	123677	Dumbledore	146	" I agree , "
123679	123722	123677	123677	Dumbledore	146	" Whatever Morfin was , he did not deserve to die as he did , blamed for murders he had not committed . But it is getting late , and I want you to see this other memory before we part . ... "

124496	124507	124454	124454	Slughorn	503	" Ask away , then , m'boy , ask away .... "
124508	124523	124454	124454	Slughorn	503	" Sir , I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes ? "
124572	124608	124558	124558	Slughorn	503	" I do n't know anything about Horcruxes and I would n't tell you if I did ! Now get out of here at once and do n’t let me catch you mentioning them again ! "
124609	124616	124618	124618	Dumbledore	146	" Well , that 's that , "
124623	124628	124618	124618	Dumbledore	146	" Time to go . "
124653	124660	124662	124662	Harry	503	" That 's all there is ? "
124731	124738	124740	124740	Dumbledore	146	" As you might have noticed , "
124748	124756	124740	124740	Dumbledore	146	" that memory has been tampered with . "
124757	124761	124763	124763	Harry	503	" Tampered with ? "
124770	124773	124775	124775	Dumbledore	146	" Certainly , "
124777	124787	124775	124775	Dumbledore	146	" Professor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections . "
124788	124796	124740	124740	Dumbledore	146	" But why would he do that ? "
124797	124811	124813	124813	Dumbledore	146	" Because , I think , he is ashamed of what he remembers , "
124815	124878	124813	124813	Dumbledore	146	" He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light , obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see . It is , as you will have noticed , very crudely done , and that is all to the good , for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations . "
124923	124929	124902	124903	Professor Slughorn	216	" Harry stared at him . "
124935	124947	124948	124948	you	985	" he said , keeping his voice as respectful as possible , "
124963	124964	124965	124966	Professor Slughorn	216	" "
124978	124982	124983	124983	He	216	" said Dumbledore . "
125025	125136	125013	125013	I	0	" No , I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by force , and might do much more harm than good ; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts . However , he has his weaknesses like the rest of us , and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defenses . It is most important that we secure the true memory , Harry . . . . How important , we will only know when we have seen the real thing . So , good luck . . . and good night . "
125153	125159	125146	125146	Harry	503	" Good night , sir . "
125176	125196	125172	125173	Phineas Nigellus	417	" I ca n't see why the boy should be able to do it better than you , Dumbledore . "
125197	125207	125209	125209	Dumbledore	146	" I would n't expect you to , Phineas , "
125475	125772	125773	125773	Harry	503	" ' Ron reckons 1 should just hang back after Potions this afternoon ... ' ' Oh , well , if Won - Won thinks that , you 'd better do it , ' she said , flaring up at once . ' After all , when has Won - Won 's judgement ever been faulty ? ' ' Hermione , ca n't you — ' ' No ! ' she said angrily , and stormed away , leaving Harry alone and ankle - deep in snow . Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days , seeing as Harry , Ron and Hermione had to share a desk . Today , Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie , and ignored both Harry and Ron . ' What 've you done ? ' Ron muttered to Harry , looking at Hermione 's haughty profile . But before Harry could answer , Slughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room . ' Settle down , settle down , please ! Quickly , now , lots of work to get through this afternoon ! Golpalott 's Third Law ... who can tell me - ? But Miss Granger can , of course ! ' Hermione recited at top speed : ' Golpalott's - Third - Law- states - that - the - antidote - for - a - blended - poison - will - be - equal - to- more - than - the - sum - of - the - antidotes - for - each - of - the - separale- components . ' ' Precisely ! ' beamed Slughorn . Ten points for Gryffindor ! Now , if we accept Golpalott 's Third Law as true ... "
127347	127990	127991	127991	she	2719	" ' Sir , 1 wondered what you know about ... about Horcruxes ? ' Slughorn froze . His round face seemed to sink in upon itself . He licked his lips and said hoarsely , ' What did you say ? ' ' I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes , sir . You see - ' ' Dumbledore put you up to this , ' whispered Slughorn . His voice had changed completely . It was not genial any more , but shocked , terrified . He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief , mopping his sweating brow . ' Dumbledore 's shown you that - that memory , ' said Slughorn . ' Well ? Has n't he ? ' ' Yes , ' said Harry , deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie . ' Yes , of course , ' said Slughorn quietly , still dabbing at his white face . ' Of course ... well , if you 've seen that memory , Harry , you 'll know that I do n't know anything - anything -he repeated the word forcefully ' - about Horcruxes . ' He seized his dragonskin briefcase , stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door . ' Sir , ' said Harry desperately , ' I just thought there might be a bit more to the memory - ' ' Did you ? ' said Slughorn . Then you were wrong , were n't you ? WRONG ! ' He bellowed the last word and , before Harry could say another word , slammed the dungeon door behind him . Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly . Ron was resentful that Harry had n't slipped him a bezoar , too . ' It would 've just looked stupid if we 'd both done it ! ' said Harry irritably . ' Look , I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort , did n't I ? Oh , will you gel a grip ! ' he added in exasperation , as Ron winced at the sound of the name . Infuriated by his failure and by Ron and Hermione 's atti- tudes , Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn . He decided that , for the time being , he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes ; it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack . When Harry did noi question Slughorn again , the Potions master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him , and appeared to have put the matter from his mind . Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties , determined to accept this time , even if he had to reschedule Quidditch prac- tice . Unfortunately , however , no such invitation arrived . Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny : neither of them had received an invitation and nor , as far as they knew , had anybody else . Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appeared , simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him . Meanwhile , the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first lime in living memory . She was so shocked , she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar , ' I have n't found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do ! "
128047	128064	128076	128076	she	2719	" of the Horcrux , wickedest of magical inventions , we shall not speak nor give direction "
128758	128775	128787	128787	she	194	" of the Horcrux , wickedest of magical inventions , we shall not speak nor give direction "
129580	129795	129801	129801	Twycross	514	" Harry said , just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him . Malfoy spun round on the spot , his hand flying to his wand , but at thai precise moment the four Heads of House shouted , ' Quiet ! ' and silence fell again . Malfoy turned slowly to face the front . Thank you , ' said Twycross . : Now then ... ' He waved his wand . Old - fashioned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in from of every student . The important things to remember when Apparating are the three Ds ! ' said Twycross . ' Destination , Determination , Deliberation ! ' Step one : fix your mind firmly upon the desired destin - ation , ' said Twycross . ' In this case , the interior of your hoop . Kindly concentrate upon that destination now . ' Everybody looked around furtively , to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop , then hastily did as they were told . Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else . This proved impossible , as he could n't stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts . "
130459	130887	130451	130451	Harry	503	" But 1 do n't care about that now- ' ' What d'you mean , you do n't care ... do n't you want to leam to Apparate ? ' said Ron incredulously . ' I 'm not fussed , really . I prefer flying , ' said Harry , glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was , and speeding up as they came into the Entrance Hall . ' Look , hurry up , will you , there 's something I want to do ... ' Perplexed , Ron followed Harry back to Gryffindor Tower at a run . They were temporarily detained by Peeves , who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their own pants , but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted short cuts . Within five minutes , they were climbing through the portrait hole . ' Are you going to tell me what we 're doing , then ? ' asked Ron , panting slightly . ' Up here , ' said Harry , and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys ' staircase . Their dormitory was , as Ham ' had hoped , empty . He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it , while Ron watched impatiently . ' Harry ... ' ' Malfoy 's using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts . He was argu - ing with Crabbe just now . 1 want to know ... aha . ' He had found it , a folded square of apparently blank parchment , which he now smoothed out and tapped with [ he tip of his wand . ' I solemn ! ) ' swear that I am up to no good ... or Malfoy is , At once , the Marauder 's Map appeared on the parchment 's surface . Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle 's floors and , moving around it , the tiny , labelled black dots that signified each of the castle 's occupants . ' Help me find Malfoy , ' said Harry urgently . He laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it , searching . ' There ! ' said Ron , after a minute or so . ' He 's in the Slytherin common room , look ... with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle ... "
131925	133387	133389	133389	Professor	221	" Ron looked thoughtfully ai the box of Chocolate Cauldrons , then shrugged and helped himself to a third . Harry tapped the map with his wand , muttered , ' Mischief managed , ' though it had n't been , and got dressed , thinking hard . There had to be an explanation for Malfoy 's periodic disappearances , but he simply could not think what it could be . The best way of finding out would be to tail him , bur even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea ; he had lessons , Quidditch practice , homework and Apparition ; he could not follow Malfoy around school all day wilhout his absence being remarked upon , ' Ready ? ' he said to Ron . He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realised that Ron had not moved , but was leaning on his bedpost , staring out of the rain - washed window with a strangely un - focused look on his face . ' Ron ? Breakfast . ' ' I 'm not hungry , ' Harry stared ai him . ' I thought you just said - ? ' -Well , all right , I 'll come down with you , ' sighed Ron , ' but I do n't want to eat . ' Harry scrutinised him suspiciously . ' You 've just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons , have n't you ? ' ' It 's not that , ' Ron sighed again . ' You ... you would n't understand . ' ' Fair enough , ' said Harry , albeit puzzled , as he turned to open the door . ' Harry ! ' said Ron suddenly . ' What ? ' ' Harry , I ca n't stand it ! ' ' You ca n't stand what ? ' asked Harry , now starling to feel definitely alarmed . Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick . ' I ca n't stop thinking about her ! ' said Ron hoarsely . Harry gaped at him . He had not expected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it . Friends they might be , but if Ron started calling Lavender ' Lav - Lav ' , he would have to pui his foot down . ' Why does that stop you having breakfast ? ' Harry asked , trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings . ' I do n't think she knows I exist , ' said Ron with a desperate gesture . ' She definitely knows you exist , ' said Harry , bewildered . ' She keeps snogging you , does n't she ? ' Ron blinked . ' Who are you talking about ? ' Who are you talking about ? ' said Harry , with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation . ' Romilda Vane , ' said Ron softly , and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it , as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight . They stared at each other for almost a whole minute , before Harry said , ' This is a joke , right ? You 're joking . ' T think ... Harry , 1 ihink I love her , ' said Ron in a strangled voice . ' OK , ' said Harry , walking up to Ron 10 get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid complexion , ' OK ... say that again with a straight face . ' ' I love her , ' repeated Ron breathlessly . ' Have you seen her hair , it 's all black and shiny and silky ... and her eyes ? Her big dark eyes ? And her - ' ' This is really funny and everything , ' said Harry impatiently , ' but joke 's over , all right ? Drop it . ' He turned to leave ; he had got two steps towards the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear . Staggering , he looked round . Ron 's fist was drawn right back , his face was contorted with rage ; he was about to strike again . Harry reacted instinctively ; his wand was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought : Le\icorpus ! Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upwards once more ; he dangled helplessly , upside - down , his robes hanging off him . ' What was that for ? ' Harry bellowed . ' You insulted her , Harry ! You said it was a joke ! ' shouted Ron , who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head . ' This is insane ! ' said Harry . ' What 's got into - ? ' And then he saw the box lying open on Ron 's bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll . ' Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons ? ' ' They were a birthday present ! ' shouted Ron , revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free . ' 1 offered you one , did n't 1 ? ' ' You just picked them up off the floor , did n't you ? ' ' They 'd fallen off my bed , all right ? Let me go ! ' ' They did n't fall off your bed , you prat , do n't you under - stand ? They were mine , 1 chucked them out of my trunk when 1 was looking for the map . They 're the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas and they 're all spiked with love potion ! ' But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron . ' Romilda ? ' he repeated . ' Did you say Romilda ? Harry - do you know her ? Can you introduce me ? ' Harry stared at the dangling Ron , whose face now looked tremendously hopeful , and fought a strong desire to laugh . A part of him - the part closest to his throbbing right ear - was quite keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off ... but on the other hand , they were supposed to be friends , Ron had not been himself when he had attacked , and Harry- thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane . ' Yeah , I 'll introduce you , ' said Harry , thinking fast . ' I 'm going to let you down now , OK ? ' He sent Ron crashing back to the floor ( his ear did hurt quite a lot ) , but Ron simply bounded to his feet again , grinning . ' She 'll be in Slughorn 's office , 1 said Harry confidently , leading the way to the door . ' Why will she be in there ? ' asked Ron anxiously , hurrying to keep up . ' Oh , she has extra Potions lessons with him , ' said Harry , inventing wildly . ' Maybe 1 could ask if 1 can have them with her ? ' said Ron eagerly . ' Great idea , ' said Harry . Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole , a complication Harry had not foreseen . ' You 're lace , Won - Won ! ' she pouted . ' I 've got you a birth - day- ' ' Leave me alone , ' said Ron impatiently , ' Harry 's going to introduce me to Romilda Vane . ' And without another word to her , he pushed his way oui of the portrait hole . Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender , but it might have turned out simply amused , because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them . Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast , but he answered his office door at the first knock , wearing a green velvet dressing - gown and matching nightcap and looking rather bleary - eyed . ' Harry , ' he mumbled . ' This is very early for a call ... I generally sleep late on a Saturday ... "
134402	134485	134386	134388	Elf Tails So	522	" said Fred . It was evening ; the hospital wing was quiet , the windows curtained , the lamps lit . Ron 's was the only occupied bed . Harry , Hermione , and Ginny were sitting around him ; they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors , trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out . Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight o'clock . Fred and George had arrived at ten past . "
134497	134518	134490	134490	we	2819	" said George grimly , putting down a large wrapped gift on Ron 's bedside cabinet and sitting beside Ginny . "

134642	134675	134640	134640	Harry	503	" Harry retold the story he had already recounted , it felt like a hundred times to Dumbledore , to McGonagall , to Madam Pomfrey , to Hermione , and to Ginny . "

134775	134889	134752	134752	you	246	" said Harry , who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hands on the little stone . Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff . She had been exceptionally quiet all day . Having hurtled , white - faced , up to Harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened . , she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginny 's obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned , but merely stood beside them , clench - jawed and frightened - looking , until ai last they had been allowed in to see him . "
134896	134901	134893	134893	Dad	242	" Fred asked Ginny . "

The dormitory doors flew open , making them all jump : Hagrid came striding toward them , his hair rain - flecked , his bearskin coat flapping behind him , a crossbow in his hand , leaving a trail of muddy dolphin - sized footprints all over the floor .

135511	135512	135504	135504	They	2839	" "
135522	135533	135504	135504	They	2839	" said Madam Pomfrey , hurrying out of her office . "
135538	135543	135504	135504	They	2839	" George pointed out . "
135551	135590	135591	135591	I	0	" said Madam Pomfrey , who seemed to have been counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness . To cover her confusion , she hurried off to clear up his muddy foot prints with her wand . "
135597	135614	135591	135591	I	0	" said Hagrid hoarsely , shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at Ron . "
135641	135642	135689	135689	Ron	217	" "
135651	135655	135689	135689	Ron	217	" said Harry . "

135678	135683	135684	135686	Firs ' Katie	523	" said Hagrid anxiously . "
135693	135694	135689	135689	Ron	217	" "
135708	135729	135731	135731	Fred	232	" said I m urge . Wood might 've done the Slytherins if he could 've got away with it , "
135755	135759	135745	135745	I	0	" said Hermione quietly "
135766	135770	135731	135731	Fred	232	" asked Fred . "
135821	135826	135841	135841	they	5066	" she added broodingly , "
135861	135922	135923	135923	Dumbledore	146	" Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement , tin- dormitory doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hurried up the ward . They had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward ; now Mrs. Weasley seized hold of Harry and hugged him very tighty . "
135935	135939	135928	135928	you	2850	" she sobbed . "
135966	135977	135979	135979	Harry	503	" Do n't be ... I did n't . . . "
135982	136002	135979	135979	Harry	503	" Half our family does seem to owe you their lives , now I stop and think about it , "
136011	136044	136003	136004	Mr. Weasley	220	" Well , all I can say is that it was a lucky clay for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Expirv . , Harry . "
136099	136104	136106	136106	Hagrid	218	" It 's terrible , "
136126	136164	136106	136106	Hagrid	218	" Ml this new security , an kids are still gettin ' hurt . . . . Dumbledoiv 's worried sick . . . . He don say much , but I can tell . . . . "
136165	136175	136177	136177	Hermione	358	" Has n't he got any ideas , Hagrid ? "
136180	136194	136196	136196	Hagrid	218	" I spect he 's got hundreds of ideas , brain like his , "
136198	136228	136230	136230	Hagrid	218	" But he doesn ' know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine , or they'dve bin caught , wouldn they ? Wha ' worries me , "
136254	136306	136233	136233	his	217	" is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein ' attacked . Chamber o ' Secrets all over again , isn ' it ? There 'll be panic , more parents takin their kids outta school , an nex ' thing yeh know the board o ' governors ... "
136330	136349	136314	136318	a long - haired woman	2857	" . . . the board o ' governors'll be talkin about shuttin ' us up fer good . "
136350	136354	136356	136356	Hermione	358	" Surely not ? "
136361	136373	136375	136375	Hagrid	218	" Got ta see it from their point o ' view , "
136378	136436	136375	136375	Hagrid	218	" I mean , it 's always bin a bit of a risk sendin a kid ter Hogwarts , hasn ’ it ? Yer expect accidents , don ' yeh , with hundreds of underage wizards all locked up tergether , but attempted murder , tha 's tliff'rent . ' S'no wonder Dumbledore 's angry with Sn — "
136461	136464	136466	136466	Harry	503	" What ? "

136477	136484	136486	136486	Hagrid	218	" I never said tha ’ , "
136501	136519	136486	136486	Hagrid	218	" Look at the time , it 's gettin ' on fer midnight , I need ter — "
136520	136530	136531	136531	Harry	503	" Hagrid , why is Dumbledore angry with Snape ? "

136548	136588	136540	136540	Hagrid	218	" Don ’ shout stuff like that , Harry , d'yeh wan ’ me ter lose me job ? Mind , I don ' suppose yeh'd care , would yeh , not now yeh've given up Care of Mag — "

136609	136615	136606	136606	Harry	503	" What 's Snape done ? "
136616	136696	136540	136540	Hagrid	218	" I dunno , Harry , I shouldn'ta heard it at all ! I — well , I was comin ’ outta the forest the other evenin ’ an ' I overheard 'em talking — well , arguin ’ . Did n't like ter draw attention to meself , so I sorta skulked an tried not ter listen , but it was a — well , a heated discussion an ' it wasn ’ easy ter block it out . "
136697	136700	136701	136701	Harry	503	" Well ? "
136713	136745	136706	136706	Hagrid	218	" Well — I jus ' heard Snape sayin ’ Dumbledore took too much fer granted an maybe he — Snape — didn ’ wan ’ ter do it any more — “
136746	136750	136540	136540	Hagrid	218	" Do what ? "
136751	136829	136830	136830	Hagrid	218	" I dunno , Harry , it sounded like Snape was feelin ’ a bit overworked , tha 's all — anyway , Dumbledore told him flat out he 'd agreed ter do it an ' that was all there was to it . Pretty firm with him . An ' then he said summat abou ’ Snape makin ' investigations in his House , in Slytherin . Well , there 's nothin' strange abou ' that ! "
136844	136860	136837	136837	Hermione	358	" All the Heads o ' Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business — "
136861	136879	136881	136881	Harry	503	" Yeah , but Dumbledore 's not having rows with the rest of them , is he ? "
136883	136886	136881	136881	Harry	503	" Look , "
136908	136938	136887	136887	Hagrid	218	" I know what yeh're like abou ' Snape , Harry , an ' I don ' want yeh ter go readin ' more inter this than there is . "
136939	136943	136945	136945	Hermione	358	" Look out , "

136987	136999	136984	136984	he	874	" Out of bed so late , this 'll mean detention ! "
137000	137008	137010	137010	Hagrid	218	" No it won ' , Filch , "
137013	137023	137010	137010	Hagrid	218	" They 're with me , aren ’ they ? "
137024	137032	137034	137034	Filch	476	" And what difference does that make ? "
137037	137053	137055	137055	Hagrid	218	" I 'm a ruddy teacher , aren ' I , yeh sneakin ' Squib ! "
137092	137096	137098	137098	Hagrid	218	" Get goin , "

137482	137493	137495	137495	McLaggen	302	" I 've been waiting for you to come back , "
137503	137537	137495	137495	McLaggen	302	" Must ’ve fallen asleep . Look , I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier . Did n't look like he 'll be fit for next week 's match . "
137552	137563	137564	137564	he	136	" Oh . . . right . . . Quidditch , "
137586	137595	137564	137564	he	136	" Yeah ... he might not make it . "
137596	137611	137613	137613	McLaggen	302	" Well , then , I 'll be playing Keeper , wo n't I ? "
137615	137618	137620	137620	Harry	136	" Yeah , "
137622	137630	137620	137620	Harry	136	" Yeah , I suppose so . ... "
137655	137658	137660	137660	McLaggen	302	" Excellent , "
137666	137672	137660	137660	McLaggen	302	" So when 's practice ? "
137673	137686	137613	137613	McLaggen	302	" What ? Oh . . . there 's one tomorrow evening . "
137687	137713	137660	137660	McLaggen	302	" Good . Listen , Potter , we should have a talk beforehand . I 've got some ideas on strategy you might find useful . "
137714	137717	137719	137719	Harry	136	" Right , "
137722	137744	137719	137719	Harry	136	" Well , I 'll hear them tomorrow , then . I 'm pretty tired now ... see you . . . "
138112	138121	138098	138098	nobody	687	" I mean , I am his girlfriend ! "
138166	138180	138181	138181	Harry	136	" Look , why do n't you talk to Ron about all this ? "
138221	138224	138213	138213	Ron	217	" serious . "
138225	138243	138245	138245	Lavender	343	" Well , I would , but he 's always asleep when I go and see him ! "
138248	138252	138254	138254	Harry	136	" Is he ? "
138298	138306	138307	138307	Lavender	343	" Is Hermione Granger still visiting him ? "
138311	138328	138330	138330	Harry	136	" Yeah , I think so . Well , they 're friends , are n't they ? "
138333	138342	138344	138344	Lavender	343	" Friends , do n't make me laugh , "
138347	138381	138344	138344	Lavender	343	" She did n't talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me ! But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he 's all interesting . ... "
138382	138391	138393	138393	Harry	136	" Would you call getting poisoned being interesting ? "
138395	138414	138416	138416	Harry	136	" Anyway — sorry , got to go — there 's McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch , "
138503	138511	138512	138512	he	136	" So how 's McLaggen shaping up ? "
138529	138535	138537	138537	Harry	136	" I 've told you , "
138540	138598	138599	138599	Harry	136	" he could be world - class and I would n't want to keep him . He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do , he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us . I ca n't wait to be shot of him . And speaking of getting shot of people , "
138612	138635	138599	138599	Harry	136	" will you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you ? She 's driving me mad as well . "
138636	138639	138641	138641	Ron	217	" Oh , "
138646	138652	138641	138641	Ron	217	" Yeah . All right . "
138653	138670	138672	138672	Harry	136	" If you do n't want to go out with her anymore , just tell her , "
138674	138692	138694	138694	Ron	217	" Yeah . . . well . . . it 's not that easy , is it ? "
138699	138709	138710	138710	he	217	" Hermione going to look in before the match ? "
138714	138728	138710	138710	he	217	" No , she 's already gone down to the pitch with Ginny . "
138729	138732	138734	138734	Ron	217	" Oh , "
138740	138758	138734	138734	Ron	217	" Right . Well , good luck . Hope you hammer McLag — I mean , Smith . "
138759	138764	138766	138766	Harry	136	" I 'll try , "
138772	138779	138766	138766	Harry	136	" See you after the match . "
138875	138881	138882	138882	Harry	136	" Where 're you going ? "
138885	138904	138906	138906	Malfoy	170	" Yeah , I 'm really going to tell you , because it 's your business , Potter , "
138908	138940	138906	138906	Malfoy	170	" You 'd better hurry up , they 'll be waiting for ' the Chosen Captain ' — ' the Boy Who Scored ' — whatever they call you these days . "
139065	139071	139073	139073	Ginny	236	" Where have you been ? "
139108	139113	139114	139114	Harry	136	" I met Malfoy , "
139129	139156	139114	139114	Harry	136	" So I wanted to know how come he 's up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here . ... "
139157	139164	139120	139120	he	136	" Does it matter right now ? "
139165	139179	139181	139181	Harry	136	" Well , I 'm not likely to find out , am I ? "
139192	139197	139203	139203	he	136	" Come on then ! "
139237	139241	139242	139242	McLaggen	302	" Tricky conditions ! "
139249	139272	139242	139242	McLaggen	302	" Coote , Peakes , you 'll want to fly out of the sun , so they do n't see you coming — "
139273	139287	139289	139289	Harry	136	" I 'm the Captain , McLaggen , shut up giving them instructions , "
139292	139301	139289	139289	Harry	136	" Just get up by the goal posts ! "
139315	139326	139327	139327	he	136	" Make sure you do fly out of the sun , "
139415	139426	139517	139518	the commentator	5676	" And that 's Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle , "
139437	139512	139517	139518	the commentator	5676	" He did the commentary last time , of course , and Ginny Weasley flew into him , I think probably on purpose , it looked like it . Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor , I expect he regrets that now he 's playing them — oh , look , he 's lost the Quaffle , Ginny took it from him , I do like her , she 's very nice . ... "
139583	139618	139573	139573	she	251	" . . . but now that big Hufflepuff player 's got the Quaffle from , her , I ca n't remember his name , it 's something like Bibble — no , Buggins — "
139619	139624	139626	139627	Professor McGonagall	251	" It 's Cadwallader ! "
139691	139712	139714	139714	Harry	136	" McLaggen , will you pay attention to what you 're supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone ! "
139723	139732	139714	139714	Harry	136	" You 're not setting a great example ! "
139743	139756	139758	139758	Luna	288	" And Harry Potter 's now having an argument with his Keeper , "
139774	139796	139765	139769	Slytherins below in the crowd	2917	" I do n't think that 'll help him find the Snitch , but maybe it 's a clever ruse . ... "
139924	139929	139986	139986	McLaggen	302	" Loser 's Lurgy . "
139930	139937	139939	139940	Professor McGonagall	251	" Seventy - forty to Hufflepuff ! "
139946	139952	139954	139954	Luna	288	" Is it , already ? "
139957	139976	139954	139954	Luna	288	" Oh , look ! The Gryffindor Keeper 's got hold of one of the Beater 's bats . "
140017	140033	140035	140035	Harry	136	" Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts ! "
140143	140151	140153	140153	Ron	217	" Nice of you to drop in , "
140217	140221	140324	140325	Madam Pomfrey	320	" What happened ? "
140222	140226	140228	140229	Madam Pomfrey	320	" Cracked skull , "
140241	140272	140228	140229	Madam Pomfrey	320	" Nothing to worry about , I mended it at once , but I 'm keeping you in overnight . You should n't over exert yourself for a few hours . "
140273	140283	140285	140285	Harry	136	" I do n't want to stay here overnight , "
140296	140306	140285	140285	Harry	136	" I want to find McLaggen and kill him . "
140307	140322	140324	140325	Madam Pomfrey	320	" I 'm afraid that would come under the heading of ' overexertion , ' "
140343	140362	140363	140363	She	320	" You will stay here until I discharge you , Potter , or I shall call the headmaster . "
140380	140389	140390	140390	he	136	" D'you know how much we lost by ? "
140397	140404	140406	140406	Ron	217	" Well , yeah I do , "
140409	140420	140406	140406	Ron	217	" Final score was three hundred and twenty to sixty . "
140421	140424	140426	140426	Harry	136	" Brilliant , "
140429	140440	140426	140426	Harry	136	" Really brilliant ! When I get hold of McLaggen — "
140441	140460	140462	140462	Ron	217	" You do n't want to get hold of him , he 's the size of a troll , "
140465	140514	140462	140462	Ron	217	" Personally , I think there 's a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Prince 's . Anyway , the rest of the team might 've dealt with him before you get out of here , they 're not happy . ... "
140577	140587	140589	140589	Ron	217	" I could hear the match commentary from here , "
140598	140615	140589	140589	Ron	217	" I hope Luna always commentates from now on . . . . Loser 's Lurgy ... "
140639	140650	140651	140651	he	217	" Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious , "
140698	140719	140690	140690	Ron	217	."She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match . How come ? You left here early enough . "
140720	140725	140727	140727	Harry	136	" Oh . . . "
140739	140802	140803	140803	Harry	136	" Yeah . . . well , I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who did n't look like they wanted to be with him , and that 's the second time he 's made sure he is n't down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school ; he skipped the last match too , remember ? "
140806	140824	140803	140803	Harry	136	" Wish I 'd followed him now , the match was such a fiasco . . . . "
140825	140831	140833	140833	Ron	217	" Do n't be stupid , "
140836	140855	140833	140833	Ron	217	" You could n't have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy , you 're the Captain ! "
140856	140867	140869	140869	Harry	136	" I want to know what he 's up to , "
140871	140893	140869	140869	Harry	136	" And do n't tell nn its all in my head , not after what I overheard between him and Snape — "
140894	140905	140907	140907	Ron	217	" I never said it was all in your head , "
140922	140967	140907	140907	Ron	217	" but there 's no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place ! You 're getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy , Harry . I mean , thinking about missing a match just to follow him ... "
140968	140977	140979	140979	Harry	136	" I want to catch him at it ! "
140983	140998	140979	140979	Harry	136	" I mean , where 's he going when he disappears off the map ? "
140999	141007	141009	141009	Ron	217	" I dunno . . . Hogsmeade ? "
141013	141039	141009	141009	Ron	217	" I 've never seen him going along any of the secret passageway on the map . I thought they were being watched now anyway ? "
141040	141047	141049	141049	Ron	217	" Well then , I dunno , "
141420	141423	141414	141414	Harry	136	" Kreacher ? "
141449	141455	141443	141443	Ron	217	" What 's going — ? "
141472	141475	141458	141458	his	136	" Muffliato ! "
141565	141573	141574	141574	he	460	" I was watching that , Potty ! "
141592	141606	141574	141574	he	460	" Look at the ickle creatures squabbling , bitey bitey , punchy punchy — "
141607	141634	141636	141636	Dobby	502	" Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby , no he wo n't , or Dobby will shut Kreacher 's mouth for him ! "
141644	141650	141652	141652	Peeves	460	" — kicky , scratchy ! "
141669	141674	141652	141652	Peeves	460	" Tweaky , pokey ! "
141675	141712	141733	141733	his	502	" Kreacher will say what he likes about his master , oh yes , and what a master he is , filthy friend of Mudbloods , oh , what would poor Kreacher 's mistress say — ? "
141789	141805	141780	141780	Peeves	460	" Stick your fingers up his nosey , draw his cork and pull his earsies — "
141815	141818	141808	141808	his	136	" Langlock ! "
141858	141862	141864	141864	Ron	217	" Nice one , "
141884	141895	141864	141864	Ron	217	" That was another Prince hex , was n't it ? "
141896	141899	141901	141901	Harry	136	" Yeah , "
141913	141949	141901	141901	Harry	136	" Right — I 'm forbidding you to fight each other ! Well , Kreacher , you 're forbidden to fight Dobby . Dobby , I know I 'm not allowed to give you orders — "
141950	141977	141979	141979	Dobby	502	" Dobby is a free house - elf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do ! "
141993	141997	141999	141999	Harry	136	" Okay then , "
142021	142026	142028	142028	Kreacher	186	" Master called me ? "
142049	142055	142057	142057	Harry	136	" Yeah , I did , "
142089	142098	142081	142081	she	320	" I 've got a job for you . "
142099	142107	142109	142109	Kreacher	186	" Kreacher will do whatever Master wants , "
142123	142142	142109	142109	Kreacher	186	" because Kreacher has no choice , but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master , yes — "
142143	142152	142154	142154	Dobby	502	" Dobby will do it , Harry Potter ! "
142168	142178	142109	142109	Kreacher	186	" Dobby would be honored to help Harry Potter ! "
142179	142196	142198	142198	Harry	136	" Come to think of it , it would be good to have both of you , "
142200	142212	142198	142198	Harry	136	" Okay then ... I want you to tail Draco Malfoy . "
142230	142261	142226	142226	Harry	136	" I want to know where he 's going , who he 's meeting , and what he 's doing . I want you to follow him around the clock . "
142262	142268	142270	142270	Dobby	502	" Yes , Harry Potter ! "
142281	142301	142274	142274	his	502	" And if Dobby does it wrong , Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower , Harry Potter ! "
142302	142312	142314	142314	Harry	136	" There wo n't be any need for that , "
142317	142329	142331	142331	Kreacher	186	" Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys ? "
142333	142352	142331	142331	Kreacher	186	" Master wants me to spy upon the pure - blood great - nephew of my old mistress ? "
142353	142359	142361	142361	Harry	136	" That 's the one , "
142374	142422	142423	142423	He	136	" And you 're forbidden to tip him off , Kreacher , or to show him what you 're up to , or to talk to him at all , or to write him messages or ... or to contact him in any way . Got it ? "
142468	142499	142457	142457	Kreacher	186	" Master thinks of everything , and Kreacher must obey him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy , oh yes . . . . "
142500	142507	142509	142509	Harry	136	" That 's settled , then , "
142511	142559	142509	142509	Harry	136	" I 'll want regular reports , but make sure I 'm not surrounded by people when you turn up . Ron and Hermione are okay . And do n't tell anyone what you 're doing . Just stick to Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters . "
142655	142662	142663	142663	he	136	" What did they row about ? "
142720	142726	142728	142728	Hermione	194	" It 's all right ! "
142737	142740	142741	142741	She	2956	" Here ... "
142752	142755	142741	142741	She	2956	" Reparo . "
142786	142794	142795	142795	he	217	" I swear they 're getting smaller , "
142798	142803	142805	142805	Harry	136	" Never mind her , "
142811	142822	142805	142805	Harry	136	" What did Ginny and Dean row about , Hermione ? "
142823	142837	142839	142839	Hermione	194	" Oh , Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludgu at you , "
142841	142848	142850	142850	Ron	217	" It must 've looked funny , "
142853	142862	142864	142864	Hermione	194	" It did n't look funny at all ! "
142867	142888	142864	142864	Hermione	194	" It looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes had n't caught Harry he could have been very badly hurt ! "
142889	142908	142910	142910	Harry	136	" Yeah , well , there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it , "
142918	142925	142910	142910	Harry	136	" Or are they still together ? "
142926	142939	142941	142941	Hermione	194	" Yes , they are — but why are you so interested ? "
142949	142962	142963	142963	he	136	" I just do n't want my Quidditch team messed up again ! "
142986	142989	142968	142968	Hermione	194	" Harry ! "
143001	143008	142968	142968	Hermione	194	" Oh , hi , Luna . "
143010	143021	143023	143023	Luna	288	" I went to the hospital wing to find you , "
143030	143038	143039	143039	She	288	" But they said you 'd left ... "
143084	143097	143079	143079	she	288	" . . . I 've been told to give you this . "
143120	143123	143124	143124	he	136	" Tonight , "
143136	143142	143144	143144	Ron	217	" Nice commentary last match ! "
143167	143179	143180	143180	she	288	" You 're making fun of me , are n't you ? "
143183	143190	143180	143180	she	288	" Everyone says I was dreadful . "
143191	143198	143200	143200	Ron	217	" No , I 'm serious ! "
143203	143220	143221	143221	he	217	" I ca n't remember enjoying commentary more ! What is this , by the way ? "
143233	143241	143242	143242	she	288	" Oh , it 's a Gurdyroot , "
143257	143284	143242	143242	she	288	" You can keep it if you like , I 've got a few of them . They 're really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies . "
143299	143311	143312	143312	he	217	" You know , she 's grown on me , Luna , "
143325	143339	143340	143340	He	217	" I know she 's insane , but it 's in a good — "
143360	143363	143365	143365	Ron	217	" Hi , "
143368	143372	143365	143365	Ron	217	" C'm on , "
143392	143412	143389	143389	Lavender	343	" Why did n't you tell me you were getting out today ? And why was she with you ? "
143544	143551	143553	143553	Harry	136	" Thanks a lot , Hermione , "
143577	143594	143564	143564	he	136	" Listen , I ’ve got to hurry or I 'll be late for Dumbledore . ... "
143668	143671	143673	143673	Dumbledore	146	" Enter , "
143699	143702	143703	143703	she	333	" Aha ! "
143720	143738	143703	143703	she	333	" So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office , Dumbledore ! "
143739	143744	143746	143746	Dumbledore	146	" My dear Sybill , "
143753	143786	143746	143746	Dumbledore	146	" there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere , but Harry does have an appointment , and I really do n't think there is any more to be said — "
143787	143791	143793	143794	Professor Trelawney	333	" Very well , "
143802	143831	143832	143832	She	333	" If you will not banish the usurping nag , so be it . ... Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated . ... "
143864	143875	143877	143877	Dumbledore	146	" Please close the door and sit down , Harry , "
143920	143933	143934	143934	Harry	136	" Professor Trelawney still is n't happy Firenze is teaching , then ? "
143937	143940	143942	143942	Dumbledore	146	" No , "
143944	144041	143942	143942	Dumbledore	146	" Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen , never having studied the subject myself . I can not ask Firenze to return to the forest , where he is now an outcast , nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave . Between ourselves , she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle . She does not know — and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her — that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort , you see . "
144051	144086	144042	144042	Dumbledore	146	" But never mind my staffing problems . We have much more important matters to discuss . Firstly — have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson ? "
144087	144090	144092	144092	Harry	136	" Ah , "
144143	144172	144133	144133	Dumbledore	146	" Well , I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions , sir , but , er , he would n't give it to me . "
144179	144183	144185	144185	Dumbledore	146	" I see , "
144214	144260	144207	144207	he	136	" And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter , do you ? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity ? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory ? "
144261	144264	144265	144265	Harry	136	" Well , "
144291	144325	144277	144277	His	136	" Well . . . the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn . I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood — "
144326	144332	144334	144334	Dumbledore	146	" And did that work ? "
144336	144348	144334	144334	Dumbledore	146	" Well , no , sir , because Ron got poisoned — "
144349	144457	144484	144484	his	146	" — which , naturally , made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory ; I would have expected nothing else , while your best friend was in danger . Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery , however , I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you . I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is . Indeed , I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it . "
144511	144514	144515	144515	he	146	" Sir , "
144522	144545	144515	144515	he	146	" it is n't that I was n't bothered or anything , I 've just had other — other things . . . "
144546	144553	144554	144554	Dumbledore	146	" Other things on your mind , "
144561	144565	144554	144554	Dumbledore	146	" I see . "
144638	144674	144635	144635	he	136	" Professor Dumbledore , I 'm really sorry . I should have done more . ... I should have realized you would n't have asked me to do it if it was n't really important . "
144675	144684	144686	144686	Dumbledore	146	" Thank you for saying that , Harry , "
144689	144724	144686	144686	Dumbledore	146	" May I hope , then , that you will give this matter higher priority from now on ? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory . "
144725	144740	144741	144741	he	146	" I 'll do it , sir , I 'll get it from him , "
144745	144757	144759	144759	Dumbledore	146	" Then we shall say no more about it just now , "
144763	144780	144759	144759	Dumbledore	146	" but continue with our story where we left off . You remember where that was ? "
144781	144786	144788	144788	Harry	136	" Yes , sir , "
144791	144828	144829	144829	he	136	" Voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it . Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked ... he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes , "
144833	144837	144839	144839	Dumbledore	146	" Very good , "
144841	144876	144839	144839	Dumbledore	146	" Now , you will remember , I hope , that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation ? "
144877	144881	144759	144759	Dumbledore	146	“ Yes , sir ”
144883	144916	144917	144917	Harry	136	" Thus far , as I hope you agree , I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen ? "
144920	144926	144928	144928	Dumbledore	146	" But now , Harry , "
144930	145013	145014	145014	Dumbledore	146	" now things become murkier and stranger . If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle , it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort . In fact , I doubt whether there is a soul alive , apart from himself , who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts . However , I have two last memories that I would like to share with you . "
145026	145048	145014	145014	Dumbledore	146	" I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely . "
145101	145125	145126	145126	he	146	" I hope you are not tired of diving into other people 's memories , for they are curious recollections , these two , "
145129	145164	145126	145126	he	146	" This first one came from a very old house - elf by the name of Hokey . Before we see what Hokey witnessed , I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts . "
145289	145290	145281	145281	Voldemort	192	" "
145296	145302	145281	145281	Voldemort	192	" Harry repeated , stunned . "
145308	145313	145281	145281	Voldemort	192	" repeated Dumbledore calmly . "
145385	145386	145387	145387	He	192	" "
145395	145403	145406	145406	he	192	" asked Harry , more amazed still . "
145421	145425	145412	145412	he	192	" said Dumbledore . "
145471	145491	145524	145524	he	192	" Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words , for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too . "
145542	145642	145524	145524	he	192	" And thirdly , as a teacher , he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wizards . Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn , the teacher with whom he was on best terms , who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play . I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts , but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground , and a place where he might begin to build himself an army . "
145643	145654	145524	145524	he	192	" But he did n't get the job , sir ? "
145655	145691	145524	145524	he	192	" No , he did not . Professor Dippet told him that he was too young at eighteen , but invited him to reapply in a few years , if he still wished to teach . "
145692	145702	145704	145704	Harry	136	" How did you feel about that , sir ? "
145707	145711	145713	145713	Dumbledore	146	" Deeply uneasy , "
145715	145770	145713	145713	Dumbledore	146	" I had advised Armando against the appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given you , for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty . But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at this school , and especially not in a position of power . "
145771	145788	145797	145797	Dumbledore	146	" Which job did he want , sir ? What subject did he want to teach ? "
145801	145836	145797	145797	Dumbledore	146	" Defense Against the Dark Arts . It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought , who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years . "
145955	145956	145960	145960	he	192	" "
145963	145972	145960	145960	he	192	" said Harry , unable to contain himself . "
145977	145986	145960	145960	he	192	" said Dumbledore , with a faint smile . "
146018	146048	146015	146016	Hepzibah Smith	541	" Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand , the cork flew out , and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve , saying as he did so , "
146054	146169	146052	146052	Harry	136	" Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them . He tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her , giving her the look of a melting iced cake . She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff , while the tiniest and oldest house - elf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers . "
146175	146180	146181	146181	He	3002	" said Hepzibah imperiously . "
146205	146257	146198	146198	he	3002	" She tucked away her powder puff as the house - elf straightened up . The top of the elf 's head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah 's chair , and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga . "
146263	146282	146260	146260	I	0	" said Hepzibah , turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror . "
146287	146339	146285	146285	madam	4866	" squeaked Hokey . Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey ’s contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question , because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion . A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped . "
146350	146542	146543	146543	I	0	" cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room , which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen things : There were cabinets full of little lacquered boxes , cases full of gold - embossed books , shelves of orbs and celestial globes , and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers . In fact , the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory . The house - elf returned within minutes , followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Voldemort . He was plainly dressed in a black suit ; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed , but all of this suited him ; he looked more handsome than ever . He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah 's fat little hand , brushing it with his lips . "
146548	146561	146543	146543	I	0	" he said quietly , producing a bunch of roses from nowhere . "
146571	146593	146594	146594	You	3006	" squealed old Hepzibah , though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table . "
146619	146647	146615	146615	Hokey	538	" The house - elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes , which she set at her mistress 's elbow . "
146653	146657	146651	146651	Tom	379	" said Hepzibah , "
146692	146703	146683	146683	I	0	" Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered . .| , ! "
146715	146725	146726	146727	Mr. Burke	542	" she asked , bat - ring her lashes . "
146742	146746	146751	146751	he	542	" said Voldemort . "
146760	146761	146751	146751	he	542	" "
146782	146786	146774	146774	you	379	" pouted Hepzibah . "
146795	146800	146774	146774	you	379	" said Voldemort quietly . "
146825	146826	146818	146819	Mr. Burke	542	" "
146834	146843	146829	146830	Mr. Burke	542	" said Hepzibah , waving a little hand . "
146933	146934	146935	146935	I	0	" "
146947	146959	146942	146943	Miss Hepzibah	543	" said Voldemort quietly , and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle . "
147001	147002	147005	147005	madam	4866	" "
147007	147067	147005	147005	madam	4866	" squeaked the house - elf , and Harry saw two leather boxes , one on top of the other , moving across the room as if of their own volition , though he knew the tiny elf was holding them over her head as she wended her way between tables , * * * pouffes , and footstools . "
147070	147096	147005	147005	madam	4866	" said Hepzibah happily , taking the boxes from the elf , laying them in her lap , and preparing to open the topmost one , "
147134	147165	147123	147123	They	3018	" She opened the lid . Harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles . "
147186	147249	147250	147251	A badger	3019	" whispered Hepzibah , and Voldemort stretched out a long - fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings . Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes . His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah ’s face , except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemort 's handsome features . "
147253	147264	147250	147251	A badger	3019	" murmured Voldemort , examining the engraving upon the cup . "
147272	147273	147274	147275	Helga Hufflepuff	545	" "
147288	147307	147274	147275	Helga Hufflepuff	545	" said Hepzibah , leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek . "
147370	147414	147357	147357	I	0	" She hooked the cup back off Voldemort 's long forefinger and restored it gently to its box , too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort 's face as the cup was taken away . "
147418	147423	147357	147357	I	0	" said Hepzibah happily , "
147442	147465	147440	147440	Hokey	538	" The elf obediently took the boxed cup , and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap . "
147477	147481	147475	147475	Tom	379	" she whispered . "
147531	147580	147518	147518	he	542	" She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box . There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket . Voldemort reached out his hand , without invitation this time , and held it up to the light , staring at it . "
147585	147600	147518	147518	he	542	" he said quietly , as the light played upon an ornate , serpentine S. "
147605	147625	147626	147626	I	0	" said Hepzibah , delighted , apparently , at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket , transfixed . "
147689	147719	147668	147687	a ragged - looking woman who seemed to have stolen it , but had no idea of its true value	3024	" There was no mistaking it this time : Voldemort 's eyes flashed scarlet at the words , and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the locket 's chain . "
147765	147808	147754	147754	I	0	" She reached out to take the locket back . For a moment , Harry thought Voldemort was not going to let go of it , but then it had slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion . “
147825	147846	147819	147819	I	0	” She looked him full in the face and for the first time , Harry saw her foolish smile falter . "
147854	147855	147852	147852	dear	4656	" "
147859	147864	147852	147852	dear	4656	" said Voldemort quietly . "
147873	147874	147875	147875	I	0	" “
147888	147912	147875	147875	I	0	" said Hepzibah , looking unnerved , and Harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in Voldemort 's eyes . "
147931	147932	147885	147885	I	0	" "
147939	147978	147937	147937	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore quietly , and as the in tie elf bobbed away bearing the boxes , Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledore 's office . "
147989	148005	148006	148006	Hokey	538	" said Dumbledore , resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should do the same . "
148026	148027	148007	148010	the house - elf	4612	" "
148031	148036	148037	148037	I	0	" said Harry angrily . "
148045	148049	148037	148037	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
148087	148088	148069	148070	somebody else	1515	" "
148092	148093	148094	148094	She	538	" "
148123	148142	148121	148121	Dumbledore	146	" It was concluded that she had not meant to do it , but being old and confused — "
148143	148156	148121	148121	Dumbledore	146	" Voldemort modified her memory , just like he did with Morfin ! "
148157	148166	148168	148168	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , that is my conclusion too , "
148170	148186	148168	148168	Dumbledore	146	" And , just as with Morfin , the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey — "
148187	148197	148199	148199	Harry	136	" — because she was a house - elf , "
148217	148220	148222	148222	Dumbledore	146	" Precisely , "
148224	148297	148222	148222	Dumbledore	146	" She was old , she admitted to having tampered with the drink , and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further . As in the case of Morfin , by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory , her life was almost over — but her memory , of course , proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket . "
148433	148436	148438	148438	Dumbledore	146	" Now , "
148440	148564	148438	148438	Dumbledore	146	" if you do n't mind , Harry , I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story . Voldemort had committed another murder ; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles , I do not know , but I think it was . This time , as you will have seen , he killed not for revenge , but for gain . He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor , besotted , old woman showed him . Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage , just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfin ’s ring , so he ran off now with Hepzibahs cup and locket . "
148565	148568	148570	148570	Harry	136	" But , "
148574	148596	148570	148570	Harry	136	" it seems mad . . . . Risking everything , throwing away his job , just for those . . . "
148597	148609	148611	148611	Dumbledore	146	" Mad to you , perhaps , but not to Voldemort , "
148613	148656	148611	148611	Dumbledore	146	" I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him , Harry , but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket , at least , as rightfully his . "
148657	148662	148664	148664	Harry	136	" The locket maybe , "
148666	148675	148664	148664	Harry	136	" but why take the cup as well ? "
148676	148687	148689	148689	Dumbledore	146	" It had belonged to another of Hogwarts ’s founders , "
148691	148740	148689	148689	Dumbledore	146	" I think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history . There were other reasons , I think . ... I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course . "
148796	148814	148788	148789	Lord Voldemort	192	" Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last memory into the Pensieve . "
148820	148824	148825	148825	Mine	0	" he asked . "
148827	148968	148825	148825	Mine	0	" said Dumbledore . And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass , landing in the very office he had just left . There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his perch , and there behind the desk was Dumbledore , who looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry , though both hands were whole and undamaged and his face was , perhaps , a little less lined . The one difference between the present - day office and this one was that it was snowing in the past ; bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge . The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something , and sure enough , moments after their arrival , there was a knock on the door and he said , "
148971	149125	148825	148825	Mine	0	" Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp . Voldemort had entered the room . His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two years ago : They were not as snake - like , the eyes were not yet scarlet , the face not yet masklike , and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle . It was as though his features had been burned and blurred ; they were waxy and oddly distorted , and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody look , though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become . He was wearing a long black cloak , and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders . The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise . Evidently this visit had been made by appointment . "
149131	149136	149129	149129	Tom	379	" said Dumbledore easily . "
149143	149144	149146	149146	you	379	" "
149148	149182	149146	149146	you	379	" said Voldemort , and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured — the very seat , by the looks of it , that Harry had just vacated in the present . "
149191	149208	149189	149189	headmaster	2562	" he said , and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been . "
149213	149214	149189	149189	headmaster	2562	" "
149221	149227	149218	149218	you	379	" said Dumbledore , smiling . "
149235	149236	149229	149229	I	0	" "
149242	149246	149229	149229	I	0	" said Voldemort . "
149254	149301	149247	149247	I	0	" Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the Pensieve , but which then was full of bottles . Having handed Voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself , he returned to the seat behind his desk . . "
149314	149328	149329	149329	They	3043	" Voldemort did not answer at once , but merely sipped his wine . "
149339	149343	149329	149329	They	3043	" he said . "
149352	149353	149347	149347	1	0	" "
149362	149370	149347	149347	1	0	" said Dumbledore , smiling , pleasantly . "
149411	149472	149401	149401	they	3043	" He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort , whose face remained expressionless . Nevertheless , Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly : Dumbledore 's refusal to use Voldemort ’s chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting , and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such . "
149483	149491	149473	149473	I	0	" said Voldemort after a short pause . "
149507	149508	149500	149500	yourself	379	" "
149511	149518	149500	149500	yourself	379	" said Dumbledore , still smiling , "
149557	149558	149548	149548	you	379	" "
149564	149568	149548	149548	you	379	" said Voldemort . "
149601	149602	149599	149599	Minister	5042	" "
149612	149616	149599	149599	Minister	5042	" said Dumbledore . "
149638	149681	149635	149635	I	0	" Voldemort inclined his head , unsmiling , and took another sip of wine . Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now , but waited , with a look of pleasant expectancy , for Voldemort to talk first . "
149686	149695	149682	149682	I	0	" he said , after a little while , "
149783	149800	149803	149803	I	0	" Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking . "
149818	149823	149808	149808	you	3055	" he said quietly . "
149846	149856	149836	149836	I	0	" Voldemort 's expression remained impassive as he said , "
149876	149877	149869	149869	You	3055	" "
149894	149899	149892	149892	you	3055	" asked Dumbledore delicately . "
149902	149914	149892	149892	you	3055	" said Voldemort , and his eyes seemed to burn red . "
149937	149938	149919	149919	I	0	" "
149945	149951	149919	149919	I	0	" Dumbledore corrected him quietly . "
149971	149998	149964	149964	me	0	" For the first time , Voldemort smiled . It was a taut leer , an evil thing , more threatening than a look of rage . "
150003	150008	149964	149964	me	0	" he said softly . "
150035	150036	150033	150033	Dumbledore	146	" "
150047	150051	150038	150038	you	3055	" suggested Dumbledore . "
150070	150074	150076	150076	you	3055	" said Voldemort . "
150108	150114	150104	150104	yours	3055	" Dumbledore raised his eyebrows . "
150144	150173	150174	150174	My	0	" Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore to know this name ; he saw Voldemort ’s eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare . "
150177	150187	150174	150174	My	0	" he said , after a moment 's pause , "
150198	150199	150200	150200	I	0	" "
150211	150215	150206	150206	you	3055	" said Dumbledore . "
150231	150232	150216	150216	I	0	" "
150237	150241	150233	150233	You	3055	" said Voldemort . "
150305	150338	150339	150339	You	3055	" There could be no doubt that Dumbledore 's detailed knowledge of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to Voldemort ; however , he rallied almost at once . "
150347	150348	150339	150339	You	3055	" "
150359	150364	150339	150339	You	3055	" said Dumbledore lightly . "
150371	150398	150367	150367	Tom	379	" Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat , the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture . "
150427	150433	150445	150445	Dumbledore	146	" Voldemort looked coldly surprised . "
150453	150454	150445	150445	Dumbledore	146	" "
150501	150505	150507	150507	you	3055	" Voldemort sneered . "
150517	150518	150507	150507	you	3055	" "
150525	150529	150521	150521	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
150559	150579	150549	150549	you	3055	" Voldemort stood up . He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever , his features thick with rage . "
150586	150587	150582	150582	your	3055	" "
150591	150598	150582	150582	your	3055	" said Dumbledore , also standing . "
150610	150611	150582	150582	your	3055	" "
150616	150628	150582	150582	your	3055	" said Dumbledore , and a great sadness filled his face . "
150670	150772	150664	150664	I	0	" For a second , Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning : He was sure that Voldemort 's hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand ; but then the moment had passed , Voldemort had turned away , the door was closing , and he was gone . Harry felt Dumbledore 's hand close over his arm again and moments later , they were standing together on almost the same spot , but there was no snow building on the window ledge , and Dumbledore 's hand was blackened and dead - looking once more . "
150775	150788	150664	150664	I	0	" said Harry at once , looking up into Dumbledore 's face . "
150801	150802	150803	150803	I	0	" "
150807	150811	150803	150803	I	0	" said Dumbledore , "
150818	150819	150823	150823	sir	985	" "
150825	150826	150827	150827	I	0	" "
150844	150848	150835	150835	you	985	" said Dumbledore . "
150873	150904	150906	150906	he	3076	" Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dumbledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him , he did not move at once . "
150925	150926	150919	150919	He	3076	" "
150940	150944	150929	150929	he	3076	" said Dumbledore . "
150985	150985	150982	150983	Lord Voldemort	192	"
151070	151079	151081	151081	Hermione	194	" You wo n't find anything in there , "
151089	151096	151098	151098	Harry	136	" Do n't start , Hermione , "
151100	151118	151098	151098	Harry	136	" If it had n't been for the Prince , Ron would n't be sitting here now . "
151119	151134	151136	151136	Hermione	194	" He would if you 'd just listened to Snape in our first year , "
151149	151154	151098	151098	Harry	136	“ Sectum - sempra ! "
151163	151167	151143	151143	He	136	" For enemies , "
151366	151375	151377	151377	Ron	217	" At least you can Apparate , though ! "
151380	151389	151377	151377	Ron	217	" You 'll have no trouble come July ! "
151390	151398	151399	151399	Harry	136	" I 've only done it once , "
151491	151514	151516	151516	Hermione	194	" I 'm telling you , the stupid Prince is n't going to be able to help you with this , Harry ! "
151521	151547	151516	151516	Hermione	194	" There 's only one way to force someone to do what you want , and that 's the Imperius Curse , which is illegal — "
151548	151557	151559	151559	Harry	136	" Yeah , I know that , thanks , "
151568	151603	151559	151559	Harry	136	" That 's why I 'm looking for something different . Dumbledorf says Veritaserum wo n't do it , but there might be something else , a potion or a spell . . . . "
151604	151614	151616	151616	Hermione	194	" You 're going about it the wrong way , "
151618	151658	151616	151616	Hermione	194	" Only you can get the memory , Dumbledore says . That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other people ca n’t . It 's not a question of slipping him a potion , anyone could do that — "
151659	151668	151670	151670	Ron	217	" How do you spell ' belligerent ' ? "
151683	151694	151670	151670	Ron	217	" It ca n't be B — U — M — "
151695	151702	151704	151704	Hermione	194	" No , it is n't , "
151713	151736	151704	151704	Hermione	194	" And ' augury ' does n't begin O — R — G either . What kind of quill are you using ? "
151737	151761	151670	151670	Ron	217	" It 's one of Fred and George 's Spell - Check ones , but I think the charm must be wearing off . "
151762	151768	151770	151770	Hermione	194	" Yes , it must , "
151780	151815	151770	151770	Hermione	194	" because we were asked how we 'd deal with dementors , not ' Dug - bogs ' , and I do n't remember you changing your name to ' Roonil Wazlib ’ either . "
151816	151820	151822	151822	Ron	217	" Ah no ! "
151832	151847	151822	151822	Ron	217	" Do n't say I 'll have to write the whole thing out again ! "
151848	151858	151860	151860	Hermione	194	" It 's okay , we can fix it , "
151873	151880	151882	151882	Ron	217	" I love you , Hermione , "
151906	151916	151897	151897	Hermione	194	" Do n't let Lavender hear you saying that . "
151917	151922	151924	151924	Ron	217	" 1 wo n't , "
151929	151941	151924	151924	Ron	217	" Or maybe I will , then she 'll ditch me . "
151942	151956	151958	151958	Harry	136	" Why do n't you ditch her if you want to finish it ? "
151960	151971	151973	151973	Ron	217	" You have n't ever chucked anyone , have you ? "
151975	151981	151973	151973	Ron	217	" You and Cho just — "
151982	151990	151992	151992	Harry	136	" Sort of fell apart , yeah , "
151994	152004	152006	152006	Ron	217	" Wish that would happen with me and Lavender , "
152036	152064	152024	152024	her	194	" But the more I hint I want to finish it , the tighter she holds on . It 's like going out with the giant squid . "
152065	152068	152070	152070	Hermione	194	" There , "
152083	152088	152090	152090	Ron	217	" Thanks a million , "
152092	152102	152090	152090	Ron	217	" Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion ? "
152214	152217	152211	152211	Harry	136	" Kreacher ! "
152231	152252	152226	152226	his	4612	" Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing , so Kreacher has come to give-- "
152267	152277	152278	152278	he	502	" Dobby has been helping too , Harry Potter ! "
152289	152314	152278	152278	he	502	" And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their re - ports together ! "
152315	152320	152322	152322	Hermione	194	" What is this ? "
152332	152340	152341	152341	Harry	136	" What 's going on , Harry ? "
152375	152388	152389	152389	he	136	" Well . . . they 've been following Malfoy for me , "
152392	152397	152399	152399	Kreacher	186	" Night and day , "
152401	152413	152415	152415	Dobby	502	" Dobby has not slept for a week , Harry Potter ! "
152427	152448	152423	152423	Hermione	194	" You have n't slept , Dobby ? But surely , Harry , you did n't tell him not to — "
152449	152458	152460	152460	Harry	136	" No , of course I did n't , "
152463	152482	152483	152483	he	136	" Dobby , you can sleep , all right ? But has either of you found out anything ? "
152496	152509	152511	152511	Kreacher	186	" Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood , "
152515	152532	152511	152511	Kreacher	186	" His features recall the fine bones of my mistress and his manners are those of — "
152533	152541	152543	152543	Dobby	502	" Draco Malfoy is a bad boy ! "
152546	152554	152543	152543	Dobby	502	" A bad boy who — who — "
152616	152623	152624	152624	he	136	" Thank you , Harry Potter , "
152627	152643	152644	152644	Harry	136	" Dobby still finds it dif - ficult to speak ill of his old masters . "
152659	152678	152648	152648	Dobby	502	" But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a house - elf ! "
152679	152696	152697	152697	Harry	136	" Yeah , we do n't need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy , "
152701	152714	152699	152699	Kreacher	186	" Let 's fast forward to where he 's actually been going . "
152726	152755	152715	152715	Kreacher	186	" Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall , he sleeps in a dormitory in the dun - geons , he attends his classes in a variety of — "
152756	152763	152765	152765	Harry	136	" Dobby , you tell me , "
152771	152782	152765	152765	Harry	136	" Has he been going anywhere he should n't have ? "
152783	152789	152791	152791	Dobby	502	" Harry Potter , sir , "
152802	152850	152791	152791	Dobby	502	" the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover , but he is still keen to avoid detection . He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students , who keep watch for him while he enters — "
152851	152857	152859	152859	Harry	136	" The Room of Requirement ! "
152880	152934	152875	152875	Ron	217	" That 's where he 's been sneaking off to ! That 's where he 's doing … whatever he 's doing ! And I bet that 's why he 's been disappearing off the map — come to think of it , I 've never seen the Room of Requirement on there ! "
152935	152946	152948	152948	Ron	217	" Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there , "
152950	152964	152966	152966	Hermione	194	" I think it 'll be part of the magic of the room , "
152968	152981	152966	152966	Hermione	194	" If you need it to be unplottable , it will be . "
152982	153001	153003	153003	Harry	136	" Dobby , have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy 's doing ? "
153006	153016	153018	153018	Dobby	502	" No , Harry Potter , that is impossible , "
153020	153027	153029	153029	Harry	136	" No , it 's not , "
153033	153061	153029	153029	Harry	136	" Malfoy got into our head - quarters there last year , so I 'll be able to get in and spy on him , no problem . "
153062	153073	153075	153075	Hermione	194	" But I do n't think you will , Harry , "
153078	153147	153075	153075	Hermione	194	" Mal - foy already knew exactly how we were using the room , did n't he , because that stupid Marietta had blabbed . He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D.A. , so it did . But you do n't know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there , so you do n't know what to ask it to transform into . "
153148	153157	153159	153159	Harry	136	" There 'll be a way around that , "
153162	153170	153159	153159	Harry	136	" You 've done brilliantly , Dobby . "
153171	153177	153179	153179	Hermione	194	" Kreachers done well too , "
153201	153217	153190	153190	his	186	" The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher , Kreacher will pretend he can not hear — "
153218	153224	153225	153225	Harry	136	" Get out of it , "
153240	153253	153231	153231	Kreacher	186	" You 'd better go and get some sleep too , Dobby . "
153254	153263	153265	153265	Dobby	502	" Thank you , Harry Potter , sir ! "
153273	153279	153281	153281	Harry	136	" How good is this ? "
153299	153314	153288	153288	Hermione	194	" We know where Malfoy 's going ! We 've got him cornered now ! "
153315	153322	153324	153324	Ron	217	" Yeah , it 's great , "
153364	153382	153384	153384	Hermione	194	" But what 's all this about him going up there with a variety of students ' ? "
153386	153413	153384	153384	Hermione	194	" How many people are in on it ? You would n't think he 'd trust lots of them to know what he 's do - ing--- "
153414	153421	153423	153423	Harry	136	" Yeah , that is weird , "
153427	153455	153456	153456	Harry	136	" I heard him telling Crabbe it was n't Crabbe 's business what he was doing ... so what 's he telling all these ... all these ... "
153469	153477	153478	153478	he	136	" God , I 've been stupid , "
153482	153519	153478	153478	he	136	" Its obvious , is n't it ? There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon . . . . He could ’ve nicked some any time during that lesson . . . . "
153520	153524	153526	153526	Ron	217	" Nicked what ? "
153528	153579	153581	153581	Harry	136	" Polyjuice Potion . He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slug - horn showed us in our first Potions lesson … There are n't a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoy … it 's just Crabbe and Goyle as usual . … Yeah , it all fits ! "
153595	153669	153581	153581	Harry	136	" They 're stupid enough to do what they 're told even if he wo n't tell them what he 's up to , but he does n't want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement , so he 's got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other people … Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch — ha ! Crabbe and Goyle ! "
153670	153677	153679	153679	Hermione	194	“ Do you mean to say , "
153685	153696	153679	153679	Hermione	194	" that that little girl whose scales I repaired — ? "
153697	153703	153705	153705	Harry	136	" Yeah , of course ! "
153712	153780	153705	153705	Harry	136	" Of course ! Malfoy must 've been inside the room at the time , so she — what am I talking about ? — he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to corne out , because there was someone there ! And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too ! We 've been walking past him all the time and not realizing it ! "
153781	153792	153794	153794	Ron	217	" He 's got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls ? "
153796	153822	153794	153794	Ron	217	" Blimey … no wonder they do n't look too happy these days . I 'm surprised they do n't tell him to stuff it . "
153823	153842	153844	153844	Harry	136	" Well , they would n't , would they , if he 's shown them his Dark Mark ? "
153846	153858	153860	153860	Hermi	384	" Hmmm ... the Dark Mark we do n't know exists , "
153885	153889	153891	153891	Harry	136	" We 'll see ”
153894	153900	153901	153901	Hermione	194	" Yes , we will , "
153911	153954	153956	153956	she	194	" But , Harry , before you get all excited , I still do n't think you 'll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what 's there first ' . And I do n't think you should forget "
153971	153991	153956	153956	she	194	" that what you 're supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn . Good night . "
154018	154023	154013	154013	he	136	" What d'you think ? "
154024	154035	154037	154037	Ron	217	" Wish I could Disapparate like a house - elf , "
154048	154059	154037	154037	Ron	217	" I 'd have that Apparition Test in the bag . "
154263	154266	154267	154267	he	136	" Look , "
154303	154346	154400	154400	she	194	" I have n't for - gotten about Slughorn , but I have n't got a clue how to get that memory off him , and until I get a brain wave why should n't I find out what Malfoy 's doing ? "
154347	154360	154362	154362	Her	194	" I 've already told you , you need to persuade Slughorn , "
154366	154398	154400	154400	she	194	" It 's not a question of tricking him or bewitching him , or Dumbledore could have done it in a second . Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement "
154419	154436	154400	154400	she	194	" you should go and find Slughorn and start appeal - ing to his better nature . "
154437	154443	154445	154445	Ron	217	" Anyone we know — ? "
154453	154456	154458	154458	Hermione	194	" Yes ! "
154471	154547	154458	154458	Hermione	194	" But it 's all right , he 's not dead — its Mundungus , he 's been arrested and sent to Azkaban ! Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary , and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished . Oh , and how horrible , a nine - year - old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents , they think he was under the Imperius Curse . "
154741	154775	154738	154738	he	136	“ I need to see what Malfoy 's doing in here ... I need to see what Malfoy 's doing in here ... I need to see what Malfoy 's doing in here ... ”
154830	154833	154835	154835	Harry	136	" Okay , "
154838	154847	154835	154835	Harry	136	" Okay ... I thought the wrong thing ... "
154870	154895	154867	154867	he	136	“ I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly ... I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly ... ”
154912	154919	154920	154920	he	136	" Oh , come off it , "
154926	154935	154920	154920	he	136	" That was a clear instruction . Fine . "
154948	154962	154936	154936	He	136	“ I need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy ... ”
155061	155073	155056	155056	Harry	136	" I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you "
155144	155150	155152	155152	Snape	221	" Late again , Potter , "
155163	155169	155152	155152	Snape	221	" Ten points from Gryfrindor . "
155214	155225	155227	155227	Snape	221	" Before we start , I want your dementor essays , "
155258	155300	155227	155227	Snape	221	" And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse . Now , if you will all open your books to page — what is it , Mr. Finnigan ? "
155301	155304	155306	155306	Seamus	330	" Sir , "
155308	155338	155306	155306	Seamus	330	" I 've been wondering , how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost ? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius — "
155339	155346	155348	155348	Snape	221	" No , there was n't , "
155354	155363	155348	155348	Snape	221	" But sir , I heard people talking — "
155364	155402	155306	155306	Seamus	330	" If you had actually read the article in question , Mr. Finnigan , you would have known that the so - called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher . "
155403	155415	155419	155419	Harry	136	" I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side , "
155425	155438	155466	155466	his	221	" Should n't he be upset Mun - dungus has been arrest — "
155439	155453	155455	155455	Snape	221	" But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject , "
155473	155491	155455	155455	Snape	221	" Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost . "
155520	155529	155530	155530	he	136	" Er — well — ghosts are transparent — "
155533	155539	155541	155541	Snape	221	" Oh , very good , "
155547	155576	155541	155541	Snape	221	" Yes , it in easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you , Potter . ' Ghosts are transparent . "
155611	155634	155596	155596	Harry	136	" Yeah , ghosts are transparent , but Inferi are dead bodies , are n't they ? So they 'd be solid — "
155635	155649	155651	155651	Snape	221	" A five - year - old could have told us as much , "
155653	155730	155651	155651	Snape	221	" The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wiz - ard 's spells . It is not alive , it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard 's bidding . A ghost , as I trust that you are all aware by now , is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth , and of course , as Potter so wisely tells us , transparent . "
155731	155750	155752	155752	Ron	217	" Well , what Harry said is the most useful if we 're trying to tell them apart ! "
155754	155810	155752	155752	Ron	217	" When we come face - to - face with one down a dark alley , we 're going to be having a look to see if its solid , are n't we , we 're not going to be asking , ' Excuse me , are you the imprint of a departed soul ? ' "
155828	155835	155837	155837	Snape	221	" Another ten points from Gryffindor , "
155839	155869	155837	155837	Snape	221	" I would ex - pect nothing more sophisticated from you , Ronald Weasley , the boy so solid he can not Apparate half an inch across a room . "
155870	155873	155875	155875	Hermione	194	" No ! "
155887	155907	155875	155875	Hermione	194	" There 's no point , you 'll just end up in deten - tion again , leave it ! "
155908	155920	155922	155922	Snape	221	" Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen , "
155928	155940	155922	155922	Snape	221	" and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse . "
156020	156031	156033	156033	Ron	217	" Snape 's right , though , is n't he ? "
156047	156069	156033	156033	Ron	217	" I dunno whether it 's worth me taking the test . I just ca n't get the hang of Apparition . "
156070	156089	156091	156091	Harry	136	" You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you , "
156094	156153	156091	156091	Harry	136	" It 'll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway . Then , if you 're still not — you know — as good as you 'd like to be , you can postpone the test , do it with me over the summer — Myrtle , this is the boys ' bathroom ! "
156188	156191	156192	156192	she	4778	" Oh , "
156196	156202	156192	156192	she	4778	" It 's you two . "
156203	156209	156211	156211	Ron	217	" Who were you expecting ? "
156220	156223	156225	156225	Myrtle	243	" Nobody , "
156236	156259	156261	156261	she	243	" He said he 'd come back and see me , but then you said you 'd pop in and visit me too "
156268	156293	156261	156261	she	243	" and I have n't seen you for months and months . I 've learned not to ex - pect too much from boys . "
156294	156305	156307	156307	Harry	136	" I thought you lived in that girls ' bathroom ? "
156325	156329	156330	156330	she	243	" I do , "
156339	156364	156330	156330	she	243	" but that does n't mean I ca nt visit other places . I came and saw you in your bath once , remember ? "
156365	156368	156370	156370	Harry	136	" Vividly , "
156372	156380	156381	156381	she	243	" But I thought he liked me , "
156385	156411	156413	156413	she	243	" Maybe if you two left , he 'd come back again . We had lots in common . I 'm sure he felt it . "
156420	156430	156432	156432	Ron	217	" When you say you had lots in common , "
156439	156451	156432	156432	Ron	217	" d'you mean he lives in an S - bend too ? "
156452	156455	156457	156457	Myrtle	243	" No , "
156470	156507	156460	156460	her	243	" I mean he 's sensitive , people bully him too , and he feels lonely and has n't got anybody to talk to , and he 's not afraid to show his feelings and cry ! "
156508	156518	156520	156520	Harry	136	" There 's been a boy in here crying ? "
156523	156528	156520	156520	Harry	136	" A young boy ? "
156529	156534	156536	156536	Myrtle	243	" Never you mind ! "
156553	156571	156545	156545	Ron	217	" I promised I would n't tell anyone , and I 'll take his secret to the — "
156572	156580	156582	156582	Ron	217	" — not the grave , surely ? "
156587	156593	156582	156582	Ron	217	" The sewers , maybe . "
156632	156637	156638	156638	he	217	" You 're right , "
156649	156668	156638	156638	he	217	" I 'll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I de - cide about taking the test . "
156762	156768	156770	156770	Hermione	194	" You 'd do better , "
156786	156805	156770	156770	Hermione	194	" to go straight to Slughorn 's of - fice and try and get that memory from him . "
156806	156812	156814	156814	Harry	136	" I 've been trying ! "
156897	156934	156961	156961	Filch	476	" He does n't want to talk to me , Hermione ! He can tell I 've been trying to get him on his own again , and he 's not going to let it happen ! ”
156935	156951	156961	156961	Filch	476	" Well , you 've just got to keep at it , have n't you ? "
157069	157081	157062	157062	he	136	" I solemnly swear that I am up to no good , "
157280	157291	157263	157263	He	136	" Hello … you're very pretty , are n't you ? "
157484	157487	157475	157475	Harry	136	" OUCH ! "
157514	157517	157518	157518	He	136	" Harry ? "
157552	157559	157560	157560	he	136	" What ’re you doing here ? "
157582	157589	157591	157591	Tonks	226	" I came to see Dumbledore , "
157610	157617	157619	157619	Harry	136	" His office is n't here , "
157621	157636	157619	157619	Harry	136	" it 's round the other side of the castle , behind the gargoyle — "
157637	157641	157643	157643	Tonks	226	" I know , "
157645	157658	157643	157643	Tonks	226	" He 's not there . Apparently he 's gone away again . "
157659	157663	157665	157665	Harry	136	" Has he ? "
157677	157691	157665	157665	Harry	136	" Hey — you do n't know where he goes , I suppose ? "
157692	157695	157697	157697	Tonks	226	" No , "
157699	157709	157697	157697	Tonks	226	" What did you want to see him about ? "
157710	157715	157717	157717	Tonks	226	" Nothing in particular , "
157733	157754	157717	157717	Tonks	226	" I just thought he might know what 's going on . I 've heard rumors … people getting hurt . "
157755	157769	157771	157771	Harry	136	" Yeah , I know , it 's all been in the papers , "
157773	157784	157771	157771	Harry	136	" That lit - tle kid trying to kill his — "
157785	157794	157796	157796	Tonks	226	" The Prophet 's often behind the times , "
157808	157824	157796	157796	Tonks	226	" You have n't had any letters from any - one in the Order recently ? "
157825	157836	157838	157838	Harry	136	" No one from the Order writes to me anymore , "
157840	157845	157838	157838	Harry	136	" not since Sirius — “
157856	157861	157862	157862	he	136	" I 'm sorry , "
157866	157877	157862	157862	he	136	" I mean ... I miss him , as well . "
157878	157881	157883	157883	Tonks	226	" What ? "
157894	157905	157888	157888	she	226	" Well . I 'll see you around , Harry . ”
158022	158032	158033	158033	Ron	217	" I did it — well , kind of ! "
158044	158077	158033	158033	Ron	217	" I was supposed to be Apparating to out - side Madam Puddifoots Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit , ended up near Scrivenshafts , but at least I moved ! "
158078	158082	158084	158084	Harry	136	" Good one , "
158086	158094	158084	158084	Harry	136	" How 'd you do , Hermione ? "
158095	158104	158106	158106	Ron	217	" Oh , she was perfect , obviously , "
158113	158164	158106	158106	Ron	217	" Perfect deliberation , divination , and desperation or whatever the hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you should 've heard Twycross going on about her — I 'll be surprised if he does n't pop the question soon — "
158165	158171	158173	158173	Hermione	194	" And what about you ? "
158178	158192	158173	158173	Hermione	194	" Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time ? "
158193	158196	158198	158198	Harry	136	" Yep , "
158200	158212	158198	158198	Harry	136	" And guess who I ran into up there ? Tonks ! "
158213	158216	158218	158218	Ron	217	" Tonks ? "
158226	158238	158247	158247	Ron	217	" Yeah , she said she 'd come to visit Dumbledore . "
158239	158245	158247	158247	Ron	217	" If you ask me , "
158258	158276	158249	158249	Harry	136	" she 's cracking up a bit . Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry . "
158277	158284	158286	158286	Hermione	194	" It ’s a bit odd , "
158296	158324	158286	158286	Hermione	194	" She 's supposed to be guarding the school , why she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when he 's not even here ? "
158325	158331	158333	158333	Harry	136	" I had a thought , "
158353	158371	158375	158375	him	136	" You do n't think she can have been ... you know ... in love with Sirius ? "
158377	158386	158375	158375	him	136	" What on earth makes you say that ? "
158387	158391	158393	158393	Harry	136	" I dunno , "
158397	158434	158393	158393	Harry	136	" but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name , and her Patronus is a big four - legged thing now . I wondered whether it had n't become ... you know ... him . "
158435	158441	158443	158443	Hermione	194	" It 's a thought , "
158446	158476	158443	158443	Hermione	194	" But I still do n't know why she 'd be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore , if that 's re - ally why she was here . "
158477	158489	158491	158491	Ron	217	" Goes back to what I said , does n't it ? "
158503	158517	158518	158518	he	217	" She 's gone a bit funny . Lost her nerve . Women , "
158524	158530	158518	158518	he	217	" they 're easily upset . "
158531	158535	158537	158537	Hermione	194	" And yet , "
158545	158580	158581	158581	Ron	217	" I doubt you 'd find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta did n't laugh at their joke about the hag , the Healer , and the Mimbulus mimbletonia . "
158665	158676	158677	158677	Hermione	194	" For the last time , just forget about Malfoy , "
158760	158766	158768	158768	Hermione	194	" It is n't Lavender , "
158771	158776	158778	158778	Ron	217	" Oh , good , "
158782	158786	158788	158789	the girl	1349	" Harry Potter ? "
158791	158800	158788	158789	the girl	1349	" I was asked to give you this . "
158801	158804	158805	158805	Harry	136	" Thanks ... "
158828	158845	158825	158825	he	136	" Dumbledore said we would n't be having any more lessons until I got the memory ! "
158846	158858	158860	158860	Hermione	194	" Maybe he wants to check on how you 're doing ? "
159011	159016	159018	159018	Harry	136	" Look at this , "
159026	159034	159035	159035	she	194	" Oh , for heaven 's sake , "
159055	159059	159060	159060	he	217	" He 's mental "
159064	159101	159060	159060	he	217	" That thing told its mates to eat Harry and me ! Told them to help themselves ! And now Hagrid ex - pects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body ! "
159102	159108	159110	159110	Hermione	194	" Its not just that , "
159112	159145	159110	159110	Hermione	194	" He 's asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security 's a million times tighter and how much trouble we 'd be in if we were caught . "
159146	159158	159160	159160	Harry	136	" We 've been down to see him by night before , "
159162	159171	159173	159173	Hermione	194	" Yes , but for something like this ? "
159175	159203	159173	159173	Hermione	194	" We 've risked a lot to help Hagrid out , but after all — Aragog 's dead . If it were a question of saving him — "
159204	159214	159216	159216	Ron	217	" — I 'd want to go even less , "
159219	159240	159216	159216	Ron	217	" You did n't meet him , Hermione . Believe me , being dead will have improved him a lot . "
159272	159283	159285	159285	Hermione	194	" Harry , you ca n't be thinking of going , "
159287	159299	159300	159300	Harry	136	" It 's such a pointless thing to get detention for . "
159303	159309	159310	159310	he	136	" Yeah , I know , "
159313	159324	159310	159310	he	136	" I s'pose Hagrid'll have to bury Aragog without us . "
159325	159331	159333	159333	Hermione	194	" Yes , he will , "
159338	159369	159333	159333	Hermione	194	" Look , Potions will be almost empty this afternoon , with us all off doing our tests . . . . Try and soften Slughorn up a bit then ! "
159370	159380	159382	159382	Harry	136	" Fifty - seventh time lucky , you think ? "
159385	159388	159390	159390	Ron	217	" Lucky , "
159393	159403	159390	159390	Ron	217	" Harry , that 's it — get lucky ! "
159404	159409	159333	159333	Hermione	194	" What d'you mean ? "
159410	159416	159333	159333	Hermione	194	" Use your lucky potion ! "
159417	159427	159429	159429	Hermione	194	" Ron , that 's — that 's it ! "
159434	159446	159447	159447	Harry	136	" Of course ! Why did n't I think of it ? "
159453	159457	159458	159458	he	136	" Felix Felicis ? "
159461	159475	159458	159458	he	136	" I dunno . . . I was sort of saving it . ... "
159476	159480	159482	159482	Ron	217	" What for ? "
159485	159498	159500	159500	Hermione	358	" What on earth is more important than this memory , Harry ? "
159577	159586	159588	159588	Hermione	358	" Harry ? Are you still with us ? "
159590	159599	159600	159600	he	217	" Wha — ? Yeah , of course , "
159607	159637	159600	159600	he	217	" Well . . . okay . If I ca n't get Slughorn to talk this afternoon , I 'll take some Felix and have another go this evening . "
159638	159645	159647	159647	Hermione	358	" That 's decided , then , "
159660	159675	159676	159676	she	358	" Destination . . . determina - tion . . . deliberation . . . "
159679	159685	159686	159686	Ron	217	" Oh , stop that , "
159690	159704	159686	159686	Ron	217	" I feel sick enough as it is — quick , hide me ! "
159705	159711	159713	159713	Hermione	358	" It is n't Lavender ! "
159733	159736	159738	159738	Ron	217	" Cool , "
159747	159759	159738	159738	Ron	217	" Blimey , they do n't look happy , do they ? "
159760	159786	159788	159788	Hermione	358	" They 're the Montgomery sisters and of course they do n't look happy , did n't you hear what happened to their little brother ? "
159790	159808	159810	159810	Ron	217	" I 'm losing track of what 's happening to everyone 's relatives , to be honest , "
159812	159856	159810	159810	Ron	217	" Well , their brother was attacked by a werewolf . The rumor is that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters . Anyway , the boy was only five and he died in St. Mungos , they could n't save him . "
159857	159861	159863	159863	Harry	136	" He died ? "
159867	159884	159863	159863	Harry	136	" But surely werewolves do n't kill , they just turn you into one of them ? "
159885	159890	159892	159892	Ron	217	" They sometimes kill , "
159900	159914	159892	159892	Ron	217	" I 've heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away . "
159915	159923	159925	159925	Harry	136	" What was the werewolf 's name ? "
159928	159941	159943	159943	Hermione	358	" Well , the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback , "
159945	159964	159966	159966	Harry	136	" I knew it — the maniac who likes attacking kids , the one Lupin told me about ! "
159975	159986	159987	159987	she	358	" Harry , you 've got to get that memory , "
159990	160019	159987	159987	she	358	" It 's all about stopping Voldemort , is n't it ? These dreadful things that are hap - pening are all down to him . . . . "
160040	160046	160047	160047	Harry	136	" You 'll do fine , "
160073	160077	160047	160047	Harry	136	" Good luck . "
160078	160083	160085	160085	Hermione	358	" And you too ! "
160118	160127	160129	160129	Slughorh	568	" All too young to Apparate just yet ? "
160132	160138	160129	160129	Slughorh	568	" Not turned seventeen yet ? "
160144	160148	160150	160150	Slughorn	216	" Ah well , "
160153	160178	160150	160150	Slughorn	216	" as we 're so few , we 'll do something for fun . I want you all to brew me up something amusing ! "
160179	160186	160188	160188	Ernie	353	" That sounds good , sir , "
160209	160220	160221	160221	he	170	" What do you mean , ' something amusing ' ? "
160225	160231	160233	160233	Slughorn	216	" Oh , surprise me , "
160432	160439	160446	160446	Slughorn	216	" An Elixir to Induce Euphoria , "
160493	160503	160505	160505	Slughorn	216	" Well , now , this looks absolutely wonderful , "
160531	160615	160616	160616	Harry	136	" Euphoria , I take it ? And what 's that I smell ? Mmmm . . . you 've added just a sprig of peppermint , have n't you ? Unorthodox , but what a stroke of inspiration , Harry , of course , that would tend to counterbalance the occa - sional side effects of excessive singing and nose - tweaking . ... I really do n't know where you get these brain waves , my boy . . . unless — "
160633	160647	160616	160616	Harry	136	" — it 's just your mother 's genes coming out in you ! "
160648	160657	160659	160659	Harry	136	" Oh . . . yeah , maybe , "
160719	160722	160712	160712	Slughorn	216	" passable . "
160738	160741	160742	160742	Harry	136	" Sir , "
160776	160791	160793	160793	Harry	136	" Professor — Professor , do n't you want to taste my po — ? "
160838	160841	160843	160843	Hermione	358	" Harry ! "
160852	160858	160843	160843	Hermione	358	" Harry , I passed ! "
160860	160864	160865	160865	he	136	" Well done ! "
160868	160872	160865	160865	he	136	" And Ron ? "
160873	160880	160882	160882	Hermione	358	" He — he just failed , "
160895	160927	160885	160885	Ron	217	" It was really unlucky , a tiny thing , the examiner just spotted that he 'd left half an eyebrow behind . . . How did it go with Slughorn ? "
160928	160932	160934	160934	Harry	136	" No joy , "
160941	160960	160934	160934	Harry	136	" Bad luck , mate , but you 'll pass next time — we can take it together . "
160961	160967	160969	160969	Ron	217	" Yeah , I s'pose , "
160972	160982	160969	160969	Ron	217	" But half an eyebrow – like that matters ! "
160983	160987	160989	160989	Hermione	358	" I know , "
160992	161000	160989	160989	Hermione	358	" it does seem really harsh . ... "
161042	161057	161058	161058	Ron	217	" So , Harry — you going to use the Felix Felicis or what ? "
161061	161070	161072	161072	Harry	136	" Yeah , I s'pose I 'd better , "
161074	161116	161072	161072	Harry	136	" I do n't reckon I 'll need all of it , not twenty - four hours ' worth , it ca n't take all night .... I 'll just take a mouthful . Two or three hours should do it . "
161117	161128	161130	161130	Ron	217	" It 's a great feeling when you take it , "
161133	161142	161130	161130	Ron	217	" Like you ca n't do anything wrong . "
161143	161150	161152	161152	Hermione	358	" What are you talking about ? "
161156	161163	161152	161152	Hermione	358	" You 've never taken any ! "
161164	161177	161179	161179	Ron	217	" Yeah , but I thought I had , did n't I ? "
161189	161194	161179	161179	Ron	217	" Same difference really ... "
161324	161330	161332	161332	Harry	136	" Well , here goes , "
161347	161354	161335	161335	he	136	" What does it feel like ? "
161429	161432	161433	161433	he	136	" Excellent , "
161436	161452	161433	161433	he	136	" Really excellent . Right . . . I 'm going down to Hagrid 's . "
161453	161456	161458	161458	Ron	217	" What ? "
161466	161482	161484	161484	Hermione	358	" No , Harry — you 've got to go and see Slughorn , remember ? "
161486	161489	161491	161491	Harry	136	" No , "
161494	161514	161491	161491	Harry	136	" I 'm going to Hagrid 's , I 've got a good feeling about going to Hagrid 's . "
161515	161528	161530	161530	Ron	217	" You 've got a good feeling about burying a giant spider ? "
161535	161538	161540	161540	Harry	136	" Yeah , "
161551	161569	161540	161540	Harry	136	" I feel like it 's the place to be tonight , you know what I mean ? "
161570	161573	161575	161575	Ron	217	" No , "
161586	161595	161597	161597	Hermione	358	" This is Felix Felicis , I suppose ? "
161608	161624	161597	161597	Hermione	358	" You have n't got another little bottle full of — I do n't know — "
161625	161630	161632	161632	Ron	217	" Essence of Insanity ? "
161655	161659	161660	161660	he	136	" Trust me , "
161663	161674	161675	161675	he	136	" I know what I 'm doing ... or at least "
161682	161686	161675	161675	he	136	" Felix does . "
161724	161734	161736	161737	Lavender Brown	343	" What were you doing up there with her ! ”
161813	161823	161824	161824	she	236	" Do n't push me , please , Dean , "
161831	161849	161824	161824	she	236	" You 're always doing that , I can get through perfectly well on my own . ... "
162152	162164	162165	162165	Slughorn	216	" I do thank you for taking the time , Pomona , "
162170	162186	162165	162165	Slughorn	216	" most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight . "
162187	162194	162196	162197	Professor Sprout	344	" Oh , I quite agree , "
162200	162206	162196	162197	Professor Sprout	344	" That enough for you ? "
162207	162212	162214	162214	Slughorn	216	" Plenty , plenty , "
162229	162270	162214	162214	Slughorn	216	" This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years , and some to spare if anybody over - stews them . . . . Well , good evening to you , and many thanks again ! "
162320	162326	162310	162310	Harry	136	" Good evening , Professor . "
162327	162339	162341	162341	Slughotn	572	" Merlin ’s beard , Harry , you made me jump , "
162352	162362	162341	162341	Slughotn	572	" How did you get out of the castle ? "
162363	162375	162377	162377	Harry	136	" I think Filch must 've forgotten to lock the doors , "
162388	162422	162341	162341	Slughotn	572	" I 'll be reporting that man , he 's more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me . . . . But why are you out then , Harry ? "
162423	162432	162434	162434	Harry	136	" Well , sir , it 's Hagrid , "
162452	162478	162479	162479	Slughorn	216	" He 's pretty upset . . . But you wo n't tell anyone , Professor ? I do n't want trouble for him . ... "
162486	162495	162496	162496	he	216	" Well , I ca n't promise that , "
162500	162528	162496	162496	he	216	" But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt , so I 'm sure he ca n't be up to anything very dreadful . .. . "
162529	162559	162573	162573	Slughorn	216	" Well , it 's this giant spider , he 's had it for years . ... It lived in the forest . ... It could talk and everything — "
162560	162571	162573	162573	Slughorn	216	" I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest , "
162585	162592	162573	162573	Slughorn	216	" It 's true , then ? "
162593	162596	162598	162598	Harry	136	" Yes , "
162600	162637	162598	162598	Harry	136	" But this one , Aragog , the first one Hagrid ever got , it died last night . He 's devastated . He wants company while he buries it and I said I 'd go . "
162638	162643	162645	162645	Slughorn	216	" Touching , touching , "
162662	162732	162733	162733	Slughorn	216	" But acromantula venom is very valuable ... If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out . . . . Of course , I would n't want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset . . . but if there was any way to procure some ... I mean , its almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while its alive . ... "
162745	162782	162733	162733	Slughorn	216	" . . . seems an awful waste not to collect it ... might get a hun - dred Galleons a pint . ... To be frank , my salary is not large . . . . "
162794	162797	162798	162798	he	136	" Well , "
162807	162839	162798	162798	he	136	" well , if you wanted to come , Professor , Hagrid would probably be really pleased . . . . Give Aragog a better send - off , you know ... "
162840	162846	162848	162848	Slughorn	216	" Yes , of course , "
162859	162933	162934	162934	He	216	" I tell you what , Harry , I 'll meet you down there with a bottle or two . . . . We 'll drink the poor beast 's — well — not health — but we 'll send it off in style , anyway , once it 's buried . And I 'll change my tie , this one is a little exuberant for the occa - sion . . . . "
162953	162957	162959	162959	Hagrid	218	" Yen came , "
162979	162990	162992	162992	Harry	136	" Yeah — Ron and Hermione could n't , though , "
162994	163000	162992	162992	Harry	136	" They 're really sorry . "
163001	163022	163023	163023	Hagrid	218	" Don — don matter . . . Hed've bin touched yeh're here , though , Harry . . . . "
163079	163086	163087	163087	he	136	" Where are we burying him ? "
163090	163094	163087	163087	he	136	" The forest ? "
163095	163100	163102	163102	Hagrid	218	" Blimey , no , "
163117	163155	163102	163102	Hagrid	218	" The other spiders won ' let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog 's gone . Turns out it was only on his orders they didn ' eat me ! Can yeh believe that , Harry ? "
163160	163162	163164	163164	Harry	136	" yes "
163206	163221	163223	163223	Hagrid	218	" Never bin an area o ' the forest I couldn ' go before ! "
163229	163281	163226	163226	his	3237	" It wasn ' easy , gettin ' Aragog 's body out o ' there , I can tell yeh — they usually eat their dead , see . . . . But I wanted ter give ' i m a nice burial ... a proper send - off . . . "
163318	163329	163288	163288	Harry	136	" Professor Slughorn met me coming down here , Hagrid . "
163330	163338	163340	163340	Hagrid	218	" Not in trouble , are yeh ? "
163347	163369	163340	163340	Hagrid	218	" Yeh shouldn ’ be outta the castle in the evenin ' , I know it , it 's my fault — "
163370	163398	163400	163400	Harry	136	" No , no , when he heard what I was doing he said he 'd like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too , "
163402	163435	163400	163400	Harry	136	" He 's gone to change into something more suitable , I think … and he said he 'd bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog 's mem - ory ... ”
163436	163440	163442	163442	Hagrid	218	" Did he ? "
163450	163518	163442	163442	Hagrid	218	" Tha 's — tha 's righ ' nice of him , that is , an ' not turnin ' yeh in ei - ther . I 've never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before . .. . Comin ' ter see old Aragog off , though , eh ? Well . . . he’d've liked that , Aragog would . . . . "
163581	163596	163558	163558	he	136	" Are we going to bury him here , Hagrid , in your garden ? "
163597	163608	163610	163610	Hagrid	218	" Jus ' beyond the pumpkin patch , I thought , "
163616	163647	163610	163610	Hagrid	218	" I 've already dug the — yeh know — grave . Jus ' thought we 'd say a few nice things over him — happy memories , yeh know — "
163701	163704	163705	163705	he	193	" Hagrid , "
163715	163725	163705	163705	he	193	" So very sorry to hear of your loss . "
163726	163734	163736	163736	Hagrid	218	" Tha 's very nice of yeh , "
163738	163756	163736	163736	Hagrid	218	" Thanks a lot . An ' thanks fer not givin Harry detention neither . . . . "
163757	163765	163767	163767	Slughorn	193	" Would n't have dreamed of it , "
163769	163784	163767	163767	Slughorn	193	" Sad night , sad night . . . Where is the poor creature ? "
163785	163789	163791	163791	Hagrid	218	" Out here , "
163797	163808	163791	163791	Hagrid	218	" Shall we — shall we do it , then ? "
163866	163869	163871	163871	Slughorn	193	" Magnificent , "
163923	163951	163910	163910	Slughorn	193	" Its not ev'ryone appreciates how beau'iful they are ’ said H grid to Slughorn 's back , tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes . "
163966	163967	163964	163964	Horace	193	" "
163978	164014	163974	163974	I	0	" said Slughorn , stepping back from the body . Harry saw the glint of a bottle disap - pear beneath his cloak , though Hagrid , mopping his eyes once more , noticed nothing . "
164026	164075	164020	164020	we	3244	" Hagrid nodded and moved forward . He heaved the gigantic spi - der into his arms and , with an enormous grunt , rolled it into the dark pit . It hit the bottom with a rather horrible , crunchy thud . Hagrid started to cry again . "
164090	164115	164083	164083	you	218	" said Slughorn , who like Harry could reach no higher than Hagrid 's el - bow , but patted it all the same . "
164125	164168	164119	164119	I	0	" He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog , Harry thought , for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said , in a slow , impressive voice , "
164234	164235	164318	164318	his	3250	" "
164248	164265	164318	164318	his	3250	" howled Hagrid , and he collapsed onto the compost heap , crying harder than ever . "
164270	164307	164318	164318	his	3250	" said Slughorn , waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell , with a muffled sort of crash , onto the dead spider , forming a smooth mound . "
164343	164398	164399	164399	I	0	" They deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table . Fang , who had been skulking in his basket during the burial , now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harry 's lap as usual . Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought . "
164408	164434	164399	164399	I	0	" he assured Harry , pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid 's bucket - sized mugs and handing it to Hagrid . "
164452	164487	164437	164439	house - elf	3251	" Harry saw , in his mind 's eye , the expression on Hermione 's face if she ever heard about this abuse of houseelves , and decided never to mention it to her . "
164494	164508	164490	164490	Harry	136	" said Slughorn , dividing a second bottle be - tween two mugs , "
164518	164526	164437	164439	house - elf	3251	" — he raised his mug high — "
164530	164531	164437	164439	house - elf	3251	" "
164534	164590	164437	164439	house - elf	3251	" said Harry and Hagrid together . Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply . Harry , however , with the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis , knew that he must not drink , so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him . "
164601	164606	164591	164591	I	0	" said Hagrid morosely . "
164624	164625	164626	164626	Sweet	577	” "
164628	164632	164626	164626	Sweet	577	" said Slughorn . "
164650	164720	164626	164626	Sweet	577	" Hagrid 's face darkened and Harry knew why : Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school , blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets . Slughorn , however , did not seem to be listening ; he was looking up at the ceiling , from which a number of brass pots hung , and also a long , silky skein of bright white hair . "
164729	164730	164727	164727	Hagrid	218	" "
164735	164740	164727	164727	Hagrid	218	" said Hagrid indifferently . "
164763	164764	164748	164748	they	3256	" "
164779	164780	164771	164771	you	218	" "
164798	164804	164781	164781	I	0	" said Hagrid , shrugging . "
164815	165076	165077	165078	Harry Potter	136	” Slughorn took another deep draught from his mug , his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now , looking , Harry knew , for more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful su ply of oak - matured mead , crystalized pineapple , and velvet smok - ing jackets . He refilled Hagrid 's mug and his own , and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was able to look after them all . Hagrid , becoming expan - sive under the influence of the drink and Slughorn 's flattering in - terest , stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry . The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point , and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast . Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Re - filling Charm without saying the incantation aloud , but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable : Indeed , Harry grinned to himself as , unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slug - liorn ( now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs ) he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill . After an hour or so , Hagrid and Slughorn began making extravagant toasts : to Hogwarts , to Dumbledore , to elf - made wine , and to- "
165080	165102	165077	165078	Harry Potter	136	" bellowed Hagrid , slopping some of his four - teenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it . "
165107	165114	165077	165078	Harry Potter	136	" cried Slughorn a little thickly , "
165130	165166	165115	165116	Parry Otter	579	" he mumbled , and drained his mug too . ; Not long after this , Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn , who pocketed it with cries of , "
165179	165213	165216	165219	the good die young	3260	" And for a while after that , Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side , arms around each other , singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo . "
165221	165247	165216	165219	the good die young	3260	" muttered Hagrid , slumping low onto the table , a little cross - eyed , while Slughorn continued to war - ble the refrain . "
165269	165293	165265	165265	Harry	136	" Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagrid 's crinkled eyes again ; he grasped Harry 's arm and shook it "
165317	165318	165324	165324	they	3264	" “
165340	165345	165346	165346	They	3264	” sang Slughorn plaintively . “
165368	165369	165358	165358	his	580	” "
165375	165397	165358	165358	his	580	" Hagrid grunted , and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep , snoring deeply . "
165400	165407	165358	165358	his	580	" said Slughorn with a hiccup . "
165418	165419	165358	165358	his	580	" "
165428	165433	165434	165434	He	580	" said Harry quietly . "
165444	165445	165434	165434	He	580	" "
165448	165457	165434	165434	He	580	" said Slughorn , repressing a large belch . "
165476	165495	165496	165496	I	0	" He looked quite at a loss for what to say , and resorted to refilling their mugs . "
165509	165514	165503	165503	you	0	" he asked awkwardly . "
165527	165546	165519	165519	I	0	" said Harry , his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in Hagrid 's heavy snores . "
165568	165569	165570	165570	I	0	" "
165576	165584	165572	165572	I	0	" said Slughorn in a hushed voice . "
165602	165629	165630	165630	He	192	" said Harry . Slughorn gave a great shudder , but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from Harry 's face . "
165640	165645	165646	165646	He	192	" said Harry remorselessly . "
165665	165666	165660	165660	She	3269	" "
165670	165674	165660	165660	She	3269	" breathed Slughorn . "
165694	165695	165729	165729	she	3269	" "
165703	165716	165718	165718	she	3269	" said Harry , in a voice barely more than a whisper . "
165752	165753	165748	165748	he	192	" "
165758	165768	165748	165748	he	192	" said Slughorn suddenly , raising a shaking hand . "
165799	165800	165792	165792	I	0	" "
165804	165814	165801	165801	I	0	" lied Harry , Felix Felicis leading him on . "
165823	165824	165815	165815	You	0	" "
165828	165840	165815	165815	You	0	" said Slughorn , his eyes brimming with tears once more . "
165874	165875	165877	165877	you	0	" "
165884	165888	165877	165877	you	0	" said Harry . "
165904	165933	165896	165896	you	0	" Hagrid 's rumbling snores filled the cabin . Harry looked steadily into Slughorn 's tear - filled eyes . The Potions master seemed unable to look away . "
165939	165943	165896	165896	you	0	" he whispered . "
165971	165972	165896	165896	you	0	" "
165976	165981	165896	165896	you	0	" said Harry clearly . "
165990	166025	165986	165986	I	0	" He knew he was safe : Felix was telling him that Slughorn would remember nothing of this in the morning . Looking Slughorn straight in the eye , Harry leaned forward a little . "
166043	166057	166058	166058	You	0	" Slughorn turned paler than ever ; his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat . "
166064	166068	166058	166058	You	0	" . . I. "
166074	166079	166058	166058	You	0	" said Harry calmly . "
166116	166117	166118	166118	You	0	“ "
166134	166135	166136	166136	Harry	136	" "
166147	166148	166149	166149	You	0	" "
166160	166169	166149	166149	You	0	" Slughorn said nothing ; he looked terrified . "
166181	166207	166176	166176	Professor	146	" Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth ; he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby . "
166215	166222	166208	166208	I	0	" he whispered through his fingers . "
166248	166249	166250	166250	You	0	" "
166263	166267	166250	166250	You	0	" said Harry . "
166280	166452	166454	166454	you	3282	" Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on . Slughorn and Harry stared at each other over the guttering candle . There was a long , long silence , but Felix Felicis told Harry not to break it , to wait . Then , very slowly , Slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand . He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small , empty bottle . Still looking into Harry 's eyes , Slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it , so that a long , silver thread of memory came away too , clinging to the wand tip . Longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung , silvery bright , from the wand . Slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled , then spread , swirling like gas . He corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to Harry . "
166460	166461	166458	166458	Professor	146	" "
166468	166484	166462	166462	You	3282	" said Professor Slughorn , tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus mustache . "
166512	166531	166504	166504	you	3282	" And he too put his head on his arms , gave a deep sigh , and fell asleep .
166617	166627	166610	166610	her	3284	" What sort of time do you call this ? "
166628	166643	166699	166701	the Fat Lady	2094	" I 'm really sorry — I had to go out for something important — "
166644	166668	166610	166610	her	3284	" Well , the password changed at midnight , so you 'll just have to sleep in the corridor , wo n't you ? "
166669	166674	166676	166676	Harry	136	" You 're joking ! "
166678	166688	166676	166676	Harry	136	" Why did it have to change at midnight ? "
166689	166697	166699	166701	the Fat Lady	2094	" That 's the way it is , "
166703	166727	166699	166701	the Fat Lady	2094	" If you 're angry , go and take it up with the headmaster , he 's the one who 's tightened security . "
166728	166731	166733	166733	Harry	136	" Fantastic , "
166743	166773	166733	166733	Harry	136	" Really brilliant . Yeah , I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here , because he 's the one who wanted me to — "
166774	166779	166699	166701	the Fat Lady	2094	" He is here , "
166786	166797	166699	166701	the Fat Lady	2094	" Professor Dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago . "
166817	166831	166833	166833	Nick	331	" I had it from the Bloody Baron , who saw him arrive , "
166835	166858	166833	166833	Nick	331	" He appeared , according to the Baron , to be in good spirits , though a little tired , of course . "
166859	166864	166866	166866	Harry	136	" Where is he ? "
166872	166873	166866	166866	Harry	136	” "
166894	166895	166897	166899	the Bloody Baron	6506	" "
166903	166904	166901	166901	Dumbledore	146	" "
166911	166915	166916	166916	I	0	" said Nick . "
166936	166937	166940	166940	he	331	" "
166943	166982	166940	166940	he	331	" said Harry , excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory . He wheeled about and sprinted off again , ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him . "
167008	167025	166995	166995	you	3292	" But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes , he was saying "
167028	167048	166995	166995	you	3292	" to Dumbledore 's gar - goyle , which leapt aside , permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase . "
167051	167092	166995	166995	you	3292	" said Dumbledore when Harry knocked . He sounded exhausted . Harry pushed open the door . There was Dumbledore 's office , looking the same as ever , but with black , star - strewn skies beyond the windows . "
167098	167104	167096	167096	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore in surprise . "
167115	167116	167117	167117	Sir	985	" "
167132	167166	167167	167167	Harry	136	" Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumbledore . For a moment or two , the headmaster looked stunned . Then his face split in a wide smile . "
167186	167228	167179	167179	I	0	" All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten , he hurried around his desk , took the bottle with Slughorn 's memory in his uninjured hand , and strode over to the cabinet where he kepi the Pensieve . "
167232	167253	167179	167179	I	0	" said Dumbledore , placing the stone basin upon the desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it . "
167269	167409	167263	167263	Harry	136	" Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor . . . . Once again he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorn 's office many years before . There was the much younger Slughorn , with his thick , shiny , straw - colored hair and his gingery - blond mustache , sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office , his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe , a small glass of wine in one hand , the other rummaging in a box of crystallized pineapple . And there were the half dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them , Marvolo 's gold - and - black ring gleaming on his finger . Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked , "
167420	167421	167422	167422	Tom	379	" "
167435	167455	167456	167456	I	0	" said Slughorn , wag - ging his finger reprovingly at Riddle , though winking at the same time . "
167483	167497	167480	167480	you	985	" Riddle smiled ; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks . "
167540	167548	167530	167530	you	985	" Several of the boys tittered again . "
167583	167623	167624	167624	I	0	" Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again . Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys , but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader . "
167636	167646	167634	167634	sir	985	" he said when the laughter had died away . "
167661	167701	167647	167647	I	0	" A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other . Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke , undoubtedly about what they knew , or suspected , regarding their gang leader 's famous ancestor . "
167704	167709	167647	167647	I	0	" said Slughorn briskly , "
167744	167764	167734	167734	I	0	" The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn 's desk chimed eleven o'clock behind him and he looked around . "
167810	167855	167808	167808	Avery	162	" One by one , the boys filed out of the room . Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk . A movement behind him made him look around ; Riddle was still standing there . "
167882	167883	167877	167877	you	3302	" "
167893	167896	167886	167886	I	0	" - ' "
167910	167911	167912	167912	Sir	985	" "
167944	167956	167927	167927	Slughorn	216	" Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts , is it ? "
167972	167978	167980	167980	Riddle	379	" Not exactly , sir , "
167982	167998	167980	167980	Riddle	379	" I came across the term while reading and I did n't fully understand it . "
167999	168040	168042	168042	Slughorn	216	" No . . . well . . . you 'd be hard - pushed to find a book at Hogwarts that 'll give you details on Horcruxes , Tom , that 's very Dark stuff , very Dark indeed , "
168044	168096	168042	168042	Slughorn	216	" But you obviously know all about them , sir ? I mean , a wizard like you — sorry , I mean , if you ca n't tell me , obviously — I just knew if anyone could tell me , you could — so I just thought I 'd – “
168173	168176	168178	168178	Slughorn	216	" Well , "
168199	168246	168178	168178	Slughorn	216	" well , it ca n't hurt to give you an overview , of course . Just so that you understand t he term . A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a per - son has concealed part of their soul . "
168247	168261	168263	168263	Riddle	379	" I do n't quite understand how that works , though , sir , "
168278	168289	168291	168291	Slughorn	216	" Well , you split your soul , you see , "
168293	168343	168291	168291	Slughorn	216	" and hide part of it in an object outside the body . Then , even if one 's body is attacked or destroyed , one can not die , for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged . But of course , existence in such a form ... "
168364	168393	168351	168351	himself	136	" I was ripped from my body , I was less than spirit , less than the meanest ghost . . . but still , I was alive . "
168394	168411	168351	168351	himself	136	" ... few would want it , Tom , very few . Death would be preferable . "
168433	168441	168425	168425	he	379	" How do you split your soul ? "
168442	168445	168447	168447	Slughorn	216	" Well , "
168450	168479	168447	168447	Slughorn	216	" you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole . Splitting n it I an act of violation , it is against nature . "
168480	168488	168425	168425	he	379	" But how do you do it ? "
168489	168534	168425	168425	he	379	" By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil . By commiting murder . Killing rips the soul apart . The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage : He would encase the torn portion — "
168535	168542	168447	168447	Slughorn	216	" Encase ? But how — ? "
168543	168559	168561	168561	Slughoin	581	" There is a spell , do not ask me , I do n't know ! "
168573	168591	168563	168563	his	581	" Do I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer ? "
168592	168601	168603	168603	Riddle	379	" No , sir , of course not , "
168606	168620	168603	168603	Riddle	379	" I 'm sorry ... I did n't mean to offend . . . "
168621	168633	168635	168635	Slughorn	216	" Not at all , not at all , not offended , "
168638	168671	168635	168635	Slughorn	216	" It is natural to feel some curiosity about these things . . . . Wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic . . . . "
168672	168677	168679	168679	Riddle	379	" Yes , sir , "
168681	168751	168679	168679	Riddle	379	" What I do n't understand , though — just out of curiosity — I mean , would one Horcrux be much use ? Can you only split your soul once ? Would n't it be better , make you stronger , to have your soul in more pieces , I mean , for instance , is n't seven the most powerfully magical number , would n't seven — ? "
168752	168759	168761	168761	Slughorn	216	" Merlin 's beard , Tom ! "
168763	168804	168761	168761	Slughorn	216	" Seven ! Is n't it bad enough to think of killing one person ? And in any case . . . bad enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . . "
168841	168845	168846	168846	he	216	" Of course , "
168849	168869	168846	168846	he	216	" this is all hypothetical , what we 're discussing , is n't it ? All academic . . . "
168870	168878	168880	168880	Riddle	379	" Yes , sir , of course , "
168883	168947	168880	168880	Riddle	379	" But all the same , Tom . . . keep it quiet , what I 've told — that 's to say , what we 've discussed . People would n't like to think we 've been chatting about Horcruxes . It 's a banned subject at Hogwarts , you know . . . . Dumbledore 's particularly fierce about it . ... "
168948	168958	168960	168960	Riddle	379	" I wo n't say a word , sir , "
169026	169032	169034	169034	Dumbledore	146	" Thank you , Harry , "
169037	169045	169034	169034	Dumbledore	146	" Let us go . . . . "
169074	169090	169092	169092	Dumbledore	146	" I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time , "
169096	169128	169092	169092	Dumbledore	146	" It confirms the theory on which I have been working , it tells me that I am right , and also how very far there is still to go . ... "
169173	169178	169180	169180	Dumbledore	146	" Well , Harry , "
169182	169228	169180	169180	Dumbledore	146	" I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard . At the same age as you are now , give or take a few months , Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal . "
169229	169238	169240	169240	Harry	136	" You think he succeeded then , sir ? "
169242	169276	169240	169240	Harry	136	" He made a Horcrux ? And that 's why he did n't die when he attacked me ? He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere ? A bit of his soul was safe ? "
169277	169284	169286	169286	Dumbledore	146	" A bit ... or more , "
169288	169393	169286	169286	Dumbledore	146	" You heard Voldemort , what he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux , what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times , rip his soul repeatedly , so as to store it in many , separately concealed Horcruxc . No book would have given him that information . As far as I know — as far , I am sure , as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two . "
169408	169427	169394	169394	Dumbledore	146	" Four years ago , I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul . "
169428	169431	169433	169433	Harry	136	" Where ? "
169435	169438	169433	169433	Harry	136	" How ? "
169439	169448	169450	169450	Dumbledore	146	" You handed it to me , Harry , "
169452	169472	169450	169450	Dumbledore	146	" The diary , Riddles diary , the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets . "
169473	169481	169483	169483	Harry	136	" I do n't understand , sir , "
169485	169612	169483	169483	Harry	136	" Well , although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the di - ary , what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never wit - nessed . A mere memory starting to act and think for itself ? A mere memory , sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen ? No , something much more sinister had lived inside that book . ... a fragment of soul , I was almost sure of it . The diary had been a Horcrux . But this raised as many questions as it answered . What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard . "
169613	169620	169622	169622	Harry	136	" 1 still do n't understand , "
169624	169704	169622	169622	Harry	136	" Well , it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — in other words , the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner . But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read , wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess some - body else , so that Slytherin 's monster would be unleashed again . "
169705	169719	169721	169721	Harry	136	" Well , he did n't want his hard work to be wasted , "
169723	169745	169721	169721	Harry	136	" He wanted people to know he was Slytherin 's heir , because he could n't take credit at the time . "
169746	169750	169752	169752	Dumbledore	146	" Quite correct , "
169756	170085	169752	169752	Dumbledore	146	" But do n't you see , Harry , that if he intended the diary to be passed to , or planted on , some future Hogwarts student , he was being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it . The point of a Horcrux is , as Professor Slughorn explained , to keep part of the self hidden and safe , not to fling it into somebody else 's path and run the risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened : That particular fragment of soul is no more ; you saw to that . The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me . It suggested that he must have made — or had been planning to make — more Horcruxes , so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental . I did not wish to be - lieve it , but nothing else seemed to make sense . Then you told me , two years later , that on the night that Volde - mort returned to his body , he made a most illuminating and alarm - ing statement to his Death Eaters . ‘ I who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality . ’ That was what you told me he said . ' Further than anybody ! ' And I thought I knew what that meant , though the Death Eaters did not . He was referring to his Horcruxes , Horcruxes in the plural , Harry , which I do n’t believe any other wizard has ever had . Yet it fitted : Lord Voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years , and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call ' usual evil ' . . . "
170086	170100	170102	170102	Harry	136	" So he 's made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people ? "
170104	170127	170102	170102	Harry	136	" Why could n't he make a Sorcerer 's Stone , or steal one , if he was so interested in immortality ? "
170128	170145	169752	169752	Dumbledore	146	" Well , we know that he tried to do just that , five years ago , "
170149	170173	170146	170147	s;n?l Dumbledore	146	" But there are several reasons why , I think , a Sorcerer 's Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort , "
170463	170464	170465	170465	He	192	" "
170470	170494	170465	170465	He	192	" said Harry , horror - struck , while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock mid outrage . "
170510	170511	170512	170512	I	0	" "
170525	170530	170517	170517	you	136	" said Dumbledore calmly . "
170617	170618	170641	170641	them	3326	" "
170626	170634	170641	170641	them	3326	" said Harry , a little desperately , "
170643	170644	170645	170645	You	136	" "
170665	170666	170667	170667	You	136	" "
170670	170675	170667	170667	You	136	" said Harry eagerly . "
170679	170694	170667	170667	You	136	" said Dumbledore , and he raised his blackened , burned - looking hand . "
170792	170793	170797	170797	you	136	" "
170801	170802	170797	170797	you	136	" "
170948	170987	171282	171282	Dumbledore	146	" However , we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily . You destroyed the diary and I the ring , but if we are right in our theory of a seven - part soul , four Horcruxes remain . "
170988	170995	170997	170997	Harry	136	" And they could be anything ? "
170999	171020	170997	170997	Harry	136	" They could be oh , in tin cans or , I dunno , empty potion bottles . . . . "
171021	171130	171282	171282	Dumbledore	146	" You are thinking of Portkeys , Harry , which must be ordinary objects , easy to overlook . But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul ? You are forgetting what I have showed you . Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies , and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride , his belief in his own superiority , his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history ; these things , suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxr with some care , favoring objects worthy of the honor . "
171131	171139	171282	171282	Dumbledore	146	" The diary was n't that special . "
171140	171173	170997	170997	Harry	136	" The diary , as you have said yourself , was proof that he was the Hire of Slytherin . I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stu - pendous importance . "
171174	171181	171183	171183	Harry	136	" So , the other Horcruxes ? "
171185	171197	171183	171183	Harry	136	" Do you think you know what they are , sir ? "
171198	171204	171206	171206	Dumbledore	146	" I can only guess , "
171208	171261	171206	171206	Dumbledore	146	" For the reasons I have al - ready given , I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that , in themselves , have a certain grandeur . I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort 's past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him . "
171262	171266	171268	171268	Harry	136	" The locket ! "
171271	171276	171268	171268	Harry	136	" Hufflepuff 's cup ! "
171277	171280	171282	171282	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , "
171286	171420	171282	171282	Dumbledore	146	" I would be prepared to bet — perhaps not my other hand — but a couple of fingers , that they be - came Horcruxes three and four . The remaining two , assuming again that he created a total of six , are more of a problem , but I will hazard a guess that , having secured objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin , he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw . Four objects from the four founders would , I am sure , have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort 's imagination . I can - not answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaw 's . I am confident , however , that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe . "
171444	171462	171464	171464	Harry	136	" Do you think that 's why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts , sir ? "
171466	171479	171464	171464	Harry	136	" To try and find something from one of the other founders ? "
171480	171485	171487	171487	Dumbledore	146	" My thoughts precisely , "
171489	171559	171487	171487	Dumbledore	146	" But unfortunately , that does not advance us much further , for he was turned away , or so I believe , without the chance to search the school . I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders ' objects . He definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now . "
171560	171580	171582	171582	Harry	136	" Even if he got something of Ravenclaw 's or of Gryffindor 's , that leaves a sixth Horcrux , "
171589	171596	171582	171582	Harry	136	" Unless he ’s got both ? "
171597	171604	171606	171606	Dumbledore	146	" I do n't think so , "
171608	171646	171606	171606	Dumbledore	146	" I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is . I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake , Nagini ? ' "
171650	171656	171606	171606	Dumbledore	146	" said Harry , startled . "
171664	171665	171582	171582	Harry	136	" "
171675	171679	171582	171582	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore , "
171906	171907	171887	171887	he	192	" "
171910	171914	171887	171887	he	192	" said Harry , "
171955	171956	171939	171939	you	3338	" "
171966	171976	171939	171939	you	3338	" said Dum - bledore , bowing his head . "
172005	172006	171939	171939	you	3338	" "
172009	172013	171939	171939	you	3338	" said Dumbledore . "
172047	172048	172051	172051	you	0	" "
172054	172059	172051	172051	you	0	" said Harry quickly , "
172072	172085	172088	172088	I	0	" Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying , "
172092	172093	172094	172094	I	0	" "
172097	172105	172094	172094	I	0	" said Harry , thoroughly taken aback . "
172109	172116	172094	172094	I	0	" said Dumbledore , smiling slightly . "
172125	172179	172094	172094	I	0	" Harry felt his heart lift . It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once . The headmasters and head - mistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore 's decision ; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted . "
172196	172204	172210	172210	Harry	136	" Harry asked , ignoring the portraits . "
172318	172319	172311	172311	his	192	" "
172333	172334	172337	172337	he	192	" "
172596	172608	172574	172574	I	0	" Harry sat in thought for a moment , then asked , "
172622	172623	172574	172574	I	0	" "
172630	172634	172626	172626	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
172696	172697	172723	172723	you	0	" "
172708	172720	172699	172699	I	0	" said Harry , be - fore he could stop himself . "
172726	172731	172723	172723	you	0	" said Dumbledore firmly . "
172745	172746	172747	172747	I	0	" "
172750	172755	172747	172747	I	0	" said Harry impatiently . "
172760	172772	172756	172756	I	0	" It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding , "
172776	172777	172780	172780	Harry	136	" "
172786	172806	172782	172782	you	136	" said Dumbledore , who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying . "
172838	172839	172836	172836	Harry	136	" "
172865	172875	172836	172836	Harry	136	" asked Harry , feeling a little let down . "
172881	172885	172836	172836	Harry	136	" said Dumbledore . "
172951	172952	172936	172936	he	192	" "
172960	172961	172936	172936	he	192	" "
172968	172989	172936	172936	he	192	" said Dumbledore , sounding impatient now . Pointing at Harry with his black , withered hand , he said , "
173000	173001	172936	172936	he	192	" "
173004	173008	173010	173010	you	0	" spluttered Harry , "
173016	173017	173010	173010	you	0	“ "
173057	173058	173044	173044	you	136	" "
173061	173067	173072	173072	you	0	" said Harry , bewildered , "
173084	173085	173086	173086	Harry	136	" "
173274	173275	173267	173267	he	192	" "
173278	173279	173267	173267	he	192	" "
173288	173316	173267	173267	he	192	" said Dumbledore , standing up and striding about the room , his glittering robes swooshing in his wake ; Harry had never seen him so agitated . "
173443	173444	173447	173447	I	0	" "
173451	173456	173457	173457	He	192	" said Harry indignantly . "
173464	173465	173457	173457	He	192	" "
173479	173486	173457	173457	He	192	" said Dum - bledore loudly . "
173684	173685	173667	173667	he	192	" "
173690	173704	173667	173667	he	192	" said Harry , making valiant efforts not to sound argu - mentative , "
173728	173729	173717	173717	I	0	" "
173733	173737	173717	173717	I	0	" said Dumbledore . "
173797	173858	173859	173859	I	0	" Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him , and thought . He thought of his mother , his father , and Sinus . He thought of Cedric Diggory . He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done . A flame seemed to leap inside his chest , searing his throat . "
173865	173870	173859	173859	I	0	" said Harry quietly . "
173879	173880	173883	173883	you	0	" "
173886	173890	173883	173883	you	0	" cried Dumbledore . "
173969	173970	173951	173951	He	192	" "
173984	173988	173951	173951	He	192	" said Harry . "
173991	174092	173951	173951	He	192	" But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him . It was , he thought , the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high . Some people , perhaps , would say that there was little to choose between the two ways , but Dumble - dore knew — and so do I , thought Harry , with a rush of fierce pride , and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world .
174176	174179	174181	174181	Ron	217	" Wow , "
174218	174241	174195	174195	his	217	" Wow . You 're actually going to go with Dumbledore . . . and try and destroy . . . wow . "
174242	174251	174253	174253	Hermione	358	" Ron , you 're making it snow , "
174308	174312	174314	174314	Ron	217	" Oh yeah , "
174325	174339	174340	174340	He	217	" Sorry ... looks like we 've all got horrible dandruff now . ... "
174366	174371	174372	174372	he	217	" We split up , "
174383	174418	174372	174372	he	217	" Last night . When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione . Obviously she could n't see you , so she thought it had just been the two of us . "
174419	174422	174424	174424	Harry	136	" Ah , "
174426	174440	174424	174424	Harry	136	" Well — you do n't mind it 's over , do you ? "
174442	174445	174446	174446	Ron	217	" No , "
174449	174470	174446	174446	Ron	217	" It was pretty bad while she was yelling , but at least I did n't have to finish it . "
174471	174474	174479	174479	she	358	" Coward , "
174483	174505	174479	174479	she	358	" Well , it was a bad night for romance all around . Ginny and Dean split up too , Harry . "
174555	174559	174552	174552	he	136	" How come ? "
174560	174603	174552	174552	he	136	" Oh , something really silly . . . She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole , like she could n't climb in herself . . . but they 've been a bit rocky for ages . "
174622	174640	174642	174642	Hermione	358	" Of course , this puts you in a bit of a dilemma , does n't it ? "
174644	174649	174651	174651	Harry	136	" What d'you mean ? "
174654	174659	174661	174661	Hermione	358	" The Quidditch team , "
174663	174673	174661	174661	Hermione	358	" If Ginnyand Dean are n't speaking . . . "
174674	174680	174682	174682	Harry	136	" Oh — oh yeah , "
174684	174687	174689	174689	Ron	217	" Flitwick , "
174746	174753	174755	174756	Professor Flitwick	383	" Now , now , boys , "
174759	174781	174755	174756	Professor Flitwick	383	" A little less talk , a little more action . . . Let me see you try . . . . "
174812	174818	174820	174821	Professor Flitwick	383	" Yes ... for homework , "
174841	174844	174820	174821	Professor Flitwick	383	" practice . "
174898	174905	174894	174894	she	358	" It 's a nice day . "
175013	175024	175010	175010	Hermione	358	" Katie ! You 're back ! Are you okay ? "
175044	175050	175051	175051	she	358	" I 'm really well ! "
175055	175103	175051	175051	she	358	" They let me out of St. Mungos on Monday , I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning . Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and the last match , Harry . . . . "
175104	175107	175109	175109	Harry	136	" Yeah , "
175111	175152	175109	175109	Harry	136	" well , now you 're back and Ron 's fit , we 'll have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw , which means we could still be in the running for the Cup . Listen , Katie . . . "
175195	175214	175174	175174	He	136	" . . . that necklace . . . can you remember who gave it to you now ? "
175215	175218	175220	175220	Katie	153	" No , "
175227	175258	175223	175223	her	153	" Everyone 's been asking me , but I have n't got a clue . The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies ' in the Three Broomsticks . "
175259	175269	175271	175271	Hermione	358	" You definitely went into the bathroom , then ? "
175273	175284	175286	175286	Katie	153	" Well , I know I pushed open the door , "
175288	175347	175348	175348	She	153	" so I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it . After that , my memory 's a blank until about two weeks ago in St. Mungo 's . Listen , I 'd better go , I would n't put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back . ... "
175383	175400	175402	175402	Hermione	358	" So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace , "
175404	175413	175402	175402	Hermione	358	" to be in the ladies ' bathroom . "
175414	175426	175428	175428	Harry	136	" Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman , "
175430	175459	175428	175428	Harry	136	" Do n't forget , there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hog - warts . We know some of it got stolen . . . . "
175482	175495	175497	175497	Harry	136	" I think I 'm going to take another swig of Felix , "
175499	175511	175497	175497	Harry	136	" and have a go at the Room of Requirement again . "
175512	175522	175524	175524	Hermione	358	" That would be a complete waste of potion , "
175543	175621	175622	175622	She	358	" Luck can only get you so far , Harry . The situation with Slughorn was different ; you always had the ability to persuade him , you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit . Luck is n't enough to get you through a powerful enchantment , though . Do n't go wasting the rest of that potion ! You 'll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him ... "
175630	175638	175639	175639	Ron	217	" Could n't we make some more ? "
175646	175666	175639	175639	Ron	217	" It 'd be great to have a stock of it . ... Have a look in the book ... "
175687	175694	175695	175695	he	136	" Blimey , its seriously complicated , "
175707	175725	175695	175695	he	136	" And it takes six months . , . You 've got to let it stew . ... "
175726	175729	175731	175731	Ron	217	" Typical , "
175766	175770	175772	175772	he	136	" For Enemies , "

177065	177085	177055	177056	Moaning Myrtle	243	" Do n't . . . tell me what 's wrong ... I can help you . . . . "
177086	177093	177095	177095	Malfoy	170	" No one can help me , "
177103	177138	177097	177097	His	170	" I ca n't do it . ... I ca n't . ... It wo n't work . . . and unless 1 do it soon ... he says he 'll kill me . ... "
177263	177271	177252	177252	Malfoy	170	" No ! No ! Stop it ! "
177285	177290	177276	177276	her	243	" Stop ! STOP ! "

177649	177681	177682	177682	He	221	" You need the hospital wing . There may be a certain amount of scarring , but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that .. . . Come .... "
177702	177716	177682	177682	He	221	" And you , Potter . . . You wait here for me . "
177801	177804	177805	177805	he	221	" Go , "
177827	177836	177838	177838	Harry	136	" I did n't mean it to happen , "
177852	177862	177842	177842	His	136	" I did n't know what that spell did . "
177868	177876	177877	177877	he	221	" Apparently I underestimated you , Potter , "
177881	177898	177877	177877	he	221	" Who would have thought you knew such Dark Magic ? Who taught you that spell ? "
177899	177907	177842	177842	His	136	" I — read about it somewhere . "
177908	177911	177877	177877	he	221	" Where ? "
177912	177920	177921	177921	Harry	136	" It was — a library book , "
177925	177935	177921	177921	Harry	136	" I ca n't remember what it was call — "
177936	177939	177941	177941	Snape	221	" Liar , "
178053	178059	178061	178061	Snape	221	" Bring me your schoolbag , "
178064	178083	178061	178061	Snape	221	" and all of your schoolbooks . All of them . Bring them to me here . Now ! "
178256	178272	178273	178273	Ron	217	" Where 've you — ? Why are you soaking — ? Is that blood . "
178292	178298	178299	178299	Harry	136	" I need your book , "
178302	178318	178299	178299	Harry	136	" Your Potions book . Quick . . . give it to me . . . "
178319	178328	178336	178336	Ron	217	" But what about the Half - Blood — "
178329	178335	178336	178336	Ron	217	" I 'll explain later ! "
179067	179083	179059	179059	he	221	" This is your copy of Advanced Potion - Making , is it , Potter ? "
179084	179087	179089	179089	Harry	136	" Yes , "
179095	179108	179089	179089	Harry	136	" You 're quite sure of that , are you , Potter ? "
179109	179112	179114	179114	Harry	136	" Yes , "
179122	179140	179114	179114	Harry	136	" This is the copy of Advanced Potion - Making that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts ? "
179141	179144	179146	179146	Harry	136	" Yes , "
179149	179153	179155	179155	Snape	221	" Then why , "
179157	179173	179155	179155	Snape	221	" does it have the name ' Roonil Wazlib ' written inside the front cover ? "
179180	179186	179187	179187	he	136	" That 's my nickname , "
179191	179195	179197	179197	Snape	221	" Your nickname , "
179200	179213	179215	179215	Harry	136	" Yeah . . . that 's what my friends call me , "
179217	179225	179227	179227	Snape	221	" I understand what a nickname is , "
179278	179288	179290	179290	Snape	221	" Do you know what I think , Potter ? "
179295	179321	179290	179290	Snape	221	" I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term . "
179329	179330	179331	179331	I	0	" "
179340	179353	179333	179333	I	0	" said Harry , still refusing to look into Snape 's eyes . "
179366	179370	179356	179356	we	3467	" said Snape . "
179381	179382	179376	179376	Potter	136	" "
179388	179396	179384	179384	sir	985	" said Harry , looking up desperately . "
179407	179408	179356	179356	we	3467	" "
179412	179425	179356	179356	we	3467	" whispered Snape , with a smile that showed his yellow teeth . "
179439	179474	179475	179475	I	0	" And he left the bathroom without another word , leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror , feeling sicker , he was sure , than Ron had ever felt in his life . "
179486	179498	179480	179480	I	0	" said Hermione , an hour later in the common room . "
179504	179667	179480	179480	I	0	" said Ron angrily . Harry had never made it to dinner ; he had no appetite at all . He had just finished telling Ron , Hermione , and Ginny what had happened , not that there seemed to have been much need . The news had traveled very fast : Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story ; Malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson , who had lost no time in vilifying Harry far and wide , and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened . Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor McGonagall , who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly Snape 's punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term . "
179680	179690	179668	179668	I	0	" Hermione said , evidently unable to stop herself . "
179699	179700	179698	179698	I.	0	" "
179710	179845	179846	179846	Harry	136	" said Harry stubbornly . He was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing him ; the looks on the Gryffindor team 's faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all . He could feel Ginny 's eyes on him now but did not meet them ; he did not want to see disappointment or anger there . He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be rejoining the team as Chaser in her place . Perhaps , if they won , Ginny and Dean would make up during the post - match euphoria . . . . The thought went through Harry like an icy knife . . . . "
179848	179852	179906	179906	he	136	" said Hermione , "
179866	179867	179869	179869	you	3472	" "
179877	179881	179869	179869	you	3472	" snapped Harry . "
179920	179921	179906	179906	he	136	" "
179928	179932	179933	179933	You	136	" said Hermione . "
179938	179947	179949	179949	Harry	136	" I 'm not defending what I did ! "
179952	180034	179949	179949	Harry	136	" I wish 1 ; had n't done it , and not just because I 've got about a dozen detentions . You know I would n't 've used a spell like that , not even on Malfoy , but you ca n't blame the Prince , he had n't written ' try this out , it 's really good ' — he was just making notes for himself , was n't he , not for anyone else . . . . "
180035	180041	180043	180043	Hermione	358	" Are you telling me , "
180045	180055	180043	180043	Hermione	358	" that you 're going to go back — ? "
180056	180067	180069	180069	Harry	136	" And get the book ? Yeah , I am , "
180072	180104	180069	180069	Harry	136	" Listen , without the Prince I 'd never have won the Felix Felicis . I 'd never have known how to save Ron from poisoning , I 'd never have — "
180105	180118	180120	180120	Hermione	358	" — got a reputation for Potions brilliance you do n't deserve , "
180123	180131	180133	180133	Ginny	236	" Give it a rest , Hermione ! "
180148	180176	180144	180144	he	136	" By the sound of it , Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Curse , you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve ! "
180177	180190	180192	180192	Hermione	358	" Well , of course I 'm glad Harry was n't cursed ! "
180197	180235	180192	180192	Hermione	358	" But you ca n't call that Sectumsempra spell good , Ginny , look where it 's landed him ! And I 'd have thought , seeing what this has done to your chances in the match — "
180236	180249	180251	180251	Ginny	236	" Oh , do n't start acting as though you understand Quidditch , "
180253	180260	180261	180261	Harry	136	" you 'll only embarrass yourself . "
180500	180505	180507	180507	Snape	221	" Ah , Potter , "
180594	180609	180611	180611	Snape	221	" Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files , "
180614	180678	180611	180611	Snape	221	" They are the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments . Where the ink has grown faint , or the cards have suffered damage from mice , we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and , making sure that they are in alphabetical order , replace them in the boxes . You will not use magic . "
180679	180684	180686	180686	Harry	136	" Right , Professor , "
180702	180709	180711	180711	Snape	221	" I thought you could start , "
180720	180759	180711	180711	Snape	221	" with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and fifty - six . You will find some familiar names in there , which should add interest to the task . Here , you see . . . "
180777	180802	180803	180803	Snape	221	" James Potter and Sirius Black . Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey . Aubreys head twice normal size . Double detention . "
180806	180829	180803	180803	Snape	221	" It must be such a comforting thing that , though they are gone , a record of their great achievements remains . "
181059	181066	181067	181067	he	221	" I think that will do , "
181071	181088	181067	181067	he	221	" Mark the place you have reached . You will continue at ten o'clock next Saturday . "
181183	181187	181188	181188	he	136	" Quid agis ? "
181211	181216	181208	181208	she	2094	" You 'll see . "
181254	181258	181260	181260	Ron	217	" We won ! "
181273	181290	181291	181291	Harry	136	" We won ! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty ! We won ! "

187250	188225	187248	187248	me	0	" he hissed angrily , as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting . ' I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement . Here - ' He shoved the Marauder 's Map into Hermione 's hand . ' You 've got to watch him and you 've got to watch Snape , too . Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the DA . Hermione , those contact Galleons will still work , right ? Dumbledore says he 's put extra protection in the school , but if Snape 's involved , he 'll know what Dumbledore 's protection is , and how to avoid it - but he wo n't be expecting you lot to be on the watch , will he ? ' ' Harry - ' began Hermione , her eyes huge with fear . ' ? have n't got time to argue , ' said Harry curtly . Take this as well - ' He thrust the socks into Ron 's hands . ‘ Thanks , ' said Ron . ' Er - why do I need socks ? ' ' You need what 's wrapped in them , it 's the Felix Felicis . Share it between yourselves and Ginny too . Say goodbye to her from me . I 'd better go , Dumbledore 's waiting - ' ' No ! ' said Hermione , as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion , looking awestruck . ' We do n't want it , you take it , who knows what you 're going to be facing ? ' ' I'Il be fine , I 'll be with Dumbledore , ' said Harry . ' I want to know you lot are OK ... do n't look like that , Hermione , I 'll see you later And he was off , hurrying back through the portrait hole towards the Entrance Hall . Dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors . He turned as Harry came skidding out on to the topmost stone step , panting hard , a searing stitch in his side . ' I would like you to wear your Cloak , please , ' said Dumbledore , and he waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying , ' Very good . Shall we go ? ' Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps , his own travelling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air . Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak , still pant - ing and sweating rather a lot . ' But what will people think when they see you leaving , Professor ? ' Harry asked , his mind on Malfoy and Snape . That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink , ' said Dumbledore lightly . ' I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom , or else visit the Hog 's Head ... or I appear to . It is as good a way as any of disguising one 's true destination . ' They made their way down the drive in the gathering twi - light . The air was full of the smells of warm grass , lake water and wood smoke from Hagrid 's cabin . It was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening . ' Professor , ' said Harry quietly , as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view , ' will we be Apparating ? ' ' Yes , ' said Dumbledore . ' You can Apparate now , I believe ? ' ' Yes , ' said Harry , ' but I have n't got a licence . ' He felt it best to be honest ; what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go ? ' No matter , ' said Dumbledore , ' I can assist you again . ' They turned out of the gates into the twilit , deserted lane to Hogsmeade . Darkness descended fast as they walked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest . Lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting . ' - and stay out ! ' shouted Madam Rosmerta , forcibly ejecting a grubby - looking wizard . ' Oh , hello , Albus ... you 're out late ... ' ' Good evening , Rosmerta , good evening ... forgive me , I 'm off to the Hog 's Head ... no offence , but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight ... ' A minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the Hog 's Head 's sign creaked a little , though there was no breeze . In contrast to the Three Broomsticks , the pub appeared to be completely empty . ' It will not be necessary for us to enter , ' muttered Dumbledore , glancing around . ' As long as nobody sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm , Harry . There is no need to grip too hard , I am merely guiding you . On the count of three - one ... two ... three ... ' Harry turned . At once , there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube ; he could not draw breath , every part of him was being com - pressed almost past endurance and then , just when he thought he must suffocate , the invisible bands seemed to burst open , and he was standing in cool darkness , breathing in lungfuls of fresh , salty air .
188363	188369	188371	188371	Dumbledore	146	" What do you think ? "
188392	188402	188404	188404	Harry	136	" They brought the kids from the orphanage here ? "
188419	188425	188427	188427	Dumbledore	146	" Not here , precisely , "
188429	188557	188427	188427	Dumbledore	146	" There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us . I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves . No , I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot . No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers , and boats can not approach the cliffs , the waters around them are too dangerous . I imagine that Riddle climbed down ; magic would have served better than ropes . And he brought two small children with him , probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them . I think the journey alone would have done it , do n't you ? "
188570	188587	188588	188588	Dumbledore	146	" But his final destination — and ours — lies a little farther on . Come . "
188661	188664	188666	188666	Dumbledore	146	" Lumos , "
188712	188716	188718	188718	Dumbledore	146	" You see ? "
188742	188753	188728	188728	Harry	136	" You will not object to getting a little wet ? "
188754	188757	188759	188759	Harry	136	" No , "
188761	188784	188759	188759	Harry	136	" Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it now — and let us take the plunge , "
189076	189084	189086	189086	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , this is the place , "
189088	189094	189095	189095	Harry	136	" How can you tell ? "
189101	189107	189109	189109	Dumbledore	146	" It has known magic , "
189158	189169	189171	189171	Dumbledore	146	" This is merely the antechamber , the entrance hall , "
189178	189212	189171	189171	Dumbledore	146	" We need to penetrate the inner place . . . . Now it is Lord Voldemort 's obstacles that stand in our way , rather than those nature made . . . . "
189288	189291	189292	189292	he	146	" Here , "
189295	189309	189292	189292	he	146	" We go on through here . The entrance is con - cealed . "
189394	189402	189404	189404	Harry	136	" You 've d - done it ! "
189436	189447	189448	189448	he	146	" Harry , I 'm so sorry , I forgot , "
189483	189487	189489	189489	Harry	136	" Thank you , "
189562	189571	189558	189558	Dumbledore	146	" Oh , surely not . So crude . "
189572	189579	189558	189558	Dumbledore	146	" What is it , Professor ? "
189580	189585	189587	189587	Dumbledore	146	" I rather think , "
189613	189624	189558	189558	Dumbledore	146	" that we are required to make payment to pass . "
189625	189628	189630	189630	Harry	136	" Payment ? "
189632	189642	189630	189630	Harry	136	" You 've got to give the door something ? "
189643	189646	189648	189648	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , "
189650	189660	189648	189648	Dumbledore	146	" Blood , if I am not much mistaken . "
189661	189664	189630	189630	Harry	136	" Blood ? "
189665	189672	189674	189674	Dumbledore	146	" I said it was crude , "
189695	189739	189630	189630	Harry	136	" The idea , as I am sure you will have gathered , is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter . Once again , Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury . "
189740	189754	189756	189756	Harry	136	" Yeah , but still , if you can avoid it . . . "
189772	189781	189783	189783	Dumbledore	146	" Sometimes , however , it is unavoidable , "
189801	189804	189806	189806	Harry	136	" Professor ! "
189816	189825	189813	189813	his	146	" I 'll do it , I 'm — "
189870	189878	189880	189880	Dumbledore	146	" You are very kind , Harry , "
189916	189940	189909	189909	Snape	221	" But your blood is worth more than mine . Ah , that seems to have done the trick , does n't it ? "
189984	189991	189996	189996	he	146	" After me , I think , "
190136	190141	190143	190143	Dumbledore	146	" Let us walk , "
190146	190162	190163	190163	He	146	" Be very careful not to step into the water . Stay close to me . "
190258	190261	190262	190262	he	136	" Professor ? "
190266	190275	190262	190262	he	136	" Do you think the Horcrux is here ? "
190276	190280	190282	190282	Dumbledore	146	" Oh yes , "
190284	190304	190282	190282	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , I 'm sure it is . The question is , how do we get to it ? "
190305	190319	190320	190320	Harry	136	" We could n't ... we could n't just try a Summoning Charm ? "
190353	190358	190360	190360	Dumbledore	146	" Certainly we could , "
190372	190380	190360	190360	Dumbledore	146	" Why do n't you do it ? "
190381	190392	190393	190393	Harry	136	" Me ? Oh . . . okay . . . "
190410	190414	190401	190401	his	136	" Accio Horcrux ! "
190486	190491	190481	190481	he	136	" What was that ? "
190492	190511	190512	190512	Harry	136	" Something , I think , that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux . "
190548	190558	190538	190538	Harry	136	" Did you think that would happen , sir ? "
190559	190602	190481	190481	he	136	" I thought something would happen if we made an obvious at - tempt to get our hands on the Horcrux . That was a very good idea , Harry ; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing . "
190603	190614	190616	190616	Harry	136	" But we do n't know what the thing was , "
190625	190634	190636	190636	Dumbledore	146	" What the things are , you mean , "
190638	190656	190636	190636	Dumbledore	146	" I doubt very much that there is only one of them . Shall we walk on ? "
190657	190660	190481	190481	he	136	" Professor ? "
190661	190666	190481	190481	he	136	" Yes , Harry ? "
190667	190682	190636	190636	Dumbledore	146	" Do you think we 're going to have to go into the lake ? "
190683	190694	190481	190481	he	136	" Into it ? Only if we are very unfortunate . "
190695	190707	190481	190481	he	136	" You do n't think the Horcrux is at the bottom ? "
190708	190721	190723	190723	Dumbledore	146	" Oh no ... I think the Horcrux is in the middle . "
190737	190753	190723	190723	Dumbledore	146	" So we 're going to have to cross the lake to get to it ? "
190754	190761	190762	190762	Harry	136	" Yes , I think so . "
190793	190796	190801	190801	he	146	" Aha , "
190844	190872	190829	190829	Dumbledore	146	" So sorry , Harry , I should have given warning . Stand back against the wall , please ; I think I have found the place . "
190943	190946	190948	190948	Dumbledore	146	" Oho , "
191127	191136	191137	191137	Harry	136	" How did you know that was there ? "
191144	191150	191152	191152	Dumbledore	146	" Magic always leaves traces , "
191165	191181	191152	191152	Dumbledore	146	" sometimes very distinctive traces . I taught Tom Riddle . I know his style . "
191182	191190	191364	191364	Dumbledore	146	" Is ... is this boat safe ? "
191191	191233	191152	191152	Dumbledore	146	" Oh yes , I think so . Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux . "
191234	191255	191152	191152	Dumbledore	146	" So the things in the water wo n't do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort 's boat ? "
191256	191300	191364	191364	Dumbledore	146	" I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will , at some point , realize we are not Lord Voldemort . Thus far , however , we have done well . They have allowed us to raise the boat . "
191301	191309	191311	191311	Harry	136	" But why have they let us ? "
191339	191362	191364	191364	Dumbledore	146	" Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat , "
191366	191419	191364	191364	Dumbledore	146	" I think he would have been prepared to risk what was , to his mind , the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it , knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate . We shall see whether he was right . "
191433	191460	191461	191461	Dumbledore	146	" It does n't look like it was built for two people . Will it hold both of us ? Will we be too heavy together ? "
191464	191514	191461	191461	Dumbledore	146	" Voldemort will not have cared about the weight , but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake . I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it . "
191515	191520	191585	191585	he	146	" But then — ? "
191521	191569	191461	191461	Dumbledore	146	" I do not think you will count , Harry : You are underage and un - qualified . Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen - year - old to reach this place : I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine . "
191588	191630	191585	191585	he	146	" Voldemort 's mistake , Harry , Voldemort 's mistake . . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth . . . . Now , you first this time , and be careful not to touch the water . "
191812	191815	191816	191816	he	136	" Professor ! "
191830	191833	191816	191816	he	136	" Harry ? "
191834	191849	191820	191820	his	136	" I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand ! "
191850	191859	191861	191861	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , I am sure you did , "
191886	191898	191864	191864	Harry	136	" So that thing that jumped out of the water — ? "
191956	191963	191965	191965	Harry	136	" There are bodies in here ! "
191981	191984	191986	191986	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , "
191989	192003	191986	191986	Dumbledore	146	" but we do not need to worry about them at the moment . "
192004	192009	192010	192010	Harry	136	" At the moment ? "
192024	192035	192037	192037	Dumbledore	146	" Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us , "
192039	192105	192037	192037	Dumbledore	146	" There is nothing to be feared from a body , Harry , any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness . Lord Voldemort , who of course secretly fears both , disagrees . But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom . It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness , nothing more . "
192149	192156	192157	192157	he	136	" But one of them jumped , "
192173	192190	192157	192157	he	136	" When I tried to Summon the Horcrux , a body leapt out of the lake . "
192191	192194	192196	192196	Dumbledore	146	" Yes , "
192198	192251	192252	192252	Dumbledore	146	" I am sure that once we take the Horcrux , we shall find them less peaceable . However , like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness , they fear light and warmth , which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise . Fire , Harry , "
192266	192275	192277	192277	Harry	136	" Oh . . . right . . . "
192373	192377	192379	192379	Dumbledore	146	" Nearly there , "
192446	192454	192456	192456	Dumbledore	146	" Careful not to touch the water , "
192581	192586	192588	192588	Harry	136	" What is it ? "
192591	192597	192599	192599	Dumbledore	146	" I am not sure , "
192601	192612	192599	192599	Dumbledore	146	" Something more worrisome than blood and bodies , however . "
192644	192654	192634	192634	his	146	" Sir , no , do n't touch — ! "
192655	192661	192663	192663	Dumbledore	146	" I can not touch , "
192668	192683	192663	192663	Dumbledore	146	" See ? I can not approach any nearer than this . You try . "
192736	192746	192748	192748	Dumbledore	146	" Out of the way , please , Harry , "
192811	192822	192794	192794	Dumbledore	146	" You think the Horcrux is in there , sir ? "
192823	192827	192828	192828	Dumbledore	146	" Oh yes . "
192854	192899	192903	192903	Dumbledore	146	" But how to reach it ? This potion can not be pen - etrated by hand , Vanished , parted , scooped up , or siphoned away , nor can it be Transfigured , Charmed , or otherwise made to change its nature . "
192929	192943	192905	192905	his	146	" I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk . "
192944	192947	192949	192949	Harry	136	" What ? "
192951	192954	192949	192949	Harry	136	" No ! "
192955	192979	192905	192905	his	146	" Yes , I think so : Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and see what lies in its depths . "
192980	192991	192905	192905	his	146	" But what if — what if it kills you ? "
192992	193004	193006	193006	Dumbledore	146	" Oh , I doubt that it would work like that , "
193009	193024	193006	193006	Dumbledore	146	" Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island . "
193045	193048	193050	193050	Harry	136	" Sir , "
193059	193068	193050	193050	Harry	136	" sir , this is Voldemort we 're — "
193069	193097	193100	193100	himself	146	" I 'm sorry , Harry ; I should have said , he would not want to im - mediately kill the person who reached this island , "
193102	193159	193100	193100	himself	146	" He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his de - fenses and , most importantly of all , why they were so intent upon emptying the basin . Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes . "
193187	193190	193191	193191	he	146	" Undoubtedly , "
193196	193281	193191	193191	he	146	" this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux . It might paralyze me , cause me to forget what I am here for , create so much pain I am dis - tracted , or render me incapable in some other way . This being the case , Harry , it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking , even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth . You understand ? "
193331	193335	193337	193337	Dumbledore	146	" You remember , "
193339	193350	193337	193337	Dumbledore	146	" the condition on which I brought you with me ? "
193371	193377	193351	193351	Harry	136	" But what if — ? "
193378	193394	193337	193337	Dumbledore	146	" You swore , did you not , to follow any command I gave you ? "
193395	193400	193351	193351	Harry	136	" Yes , but — "
193401	193416	193351	193351	Harry	136	" I warned you , did I not , that there might be danger ? "
193417	193420	193422	193422	Harry	136	" Yes , "
193424	193427	193422	193422	Harry	136	" but — "
193428	193433	193435	193435	Dumbledore	146	" Well , then , "
193449	193455	193435	193435	Dumbledore	146	" you have my orders . "
193456	193466	193468	193468	Harry	136	" Why ca n't I drink the potion instead ? "
193471	193486	193488	193488	Dumbledore	146	" Because I am much older , much cleverer , and much less valuable , "
193490	193517	193488	193488	Dumbledore	146	" Once and for all , Harry , do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking ? "
193518	193523	193559	193559	Dumbledore	146	" Could n't — ? "
193524	193530	193559	193559	Dumbledore	146	" Do I have it ? "
193531	193534	193488	193488	Dumbledore	146	" But — "
193535	193541	193559	193559	Dumbledore	146	" Your word , Harry . "
193542	193550	193559	193559	Dumbledore	146	" I — all right , but — "
193621	193628	193614	193614	Dumbledore	146	" Your good health , Harry . "
193656	193659	193660	193660	he	136	" Professor ? "
193671	193677	193665	193665	Dumbledore	146	" How do you feel ? "
193753	193757	193759	193759	Harry	136	" Professor Dumbledore ? "
193765	193771	193761	193761	his	136	" Can you hear me ? "
193824	193832	193833	193833	he	136	" Professor , can you hear me ? "
193869	193882	193837	193837	his	136	" I do n't want . . . Do n't make me ... "
193912	193928	193930	193930	Dumbledore	146	" . . . do n't like . . . want to stop . . . "
193932	193944	193946	193946	Harry	136	" You . . . you ca n't stop , Professor , "
193948	193971	193946	193946	Harry	136	" You 've got to keep drinking , remember ? You told me you had to keep drinking . Here . . . "
194006	194009	194010	194010	he	146	" No ... "
194028	194052	194010	194010	he	146	" I do n't want to . ... I do n't want to . . . . Let me go . . . . "
194053	194060	194062	194062	Harry	136	" Its all right , Professor , "
194068	194077	194062	194062	Harry	136	" Its all right , I 'm here — "
194078	194087	194089	194089	Dumbledore	146	" Make it stop , make it stop , "
194091	194103	194105	194105	Harry	136	" Yes .. . yes , this 'll make it stop , "

196694	199573	196682	196682	his	0	" And to Harry 's horror , Dumbledore sank on to the ground . ' Sir - it 's OK , sir , you 're going to be all right , do n't worry - ' He looked around desperately for help , but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing . ' We need to get you up to the school , sir ... Madam Pomfrey ... ' ' No , ' said Dumbledore . ' It is ... Professor Snape whom I need ... but I do not think ... I can walk very far just yet ... ' ' Right - sir , listen - I 'm going to knock on a door , find a place you can stay - then I can run and get Madam - ' ' Severus , ' said Dumbledore clearly . ' I need Severus ... ' ' All right then , Snape - but I 'm going to have to leave you for a moment so I can - ' Before Harry could make a move , however , he heard run- ning footsteps . His heart leapt : somebody had seen , somebody knew they needed help - and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street towards them on high - heeled , fluffy slippers , wearing a silk dressing - gown embroidered with dragons . ' I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains ! Thank goodness , thank goodness , I could n't think what to - but what 's wrong with Albus ? ' She came to a halt , panting , and stared down , wide - eyed , at Dumbledore . ' He 's hurt , ' said Harry . ' Madam Rosmerta , can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him ? ' ' You ca n't go up there alone ! Do n't you realise - have n't you seen - ? ' ' If you help me support him , ' said Harry , not listening to her , ' I think we can get him inside - ' ' What has happened ? ' asked Dumbledore . ' Rosmerta , what 's wrong ? ' The - the Dark Mark , Albus . ' And she pointed into the sky , in the direction of Hogwarts . Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the words ... he turned and looked . There it was , hanging in the sky above the school : the blaz- ing green skull with a serpent tongue , the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a building ... wherever they had murdered ... ' When did it appear ? ' asked Dumbledore , and his hand clenched painfully upon Harry 's shoulder as he struggled to his feet . ' Must have been minutes ago , it was n't there when I put the cat out , but when I got upstairs - ' ' We need to return to the castle at once , ' said Dumbledore . ' Rosmerta , ' and though he staggered a little , he seemed wholly in command of the situation , ' we need transport - brooms - ' ' I 've got a couple behind the bar , ' she said , looking very frightened . ' Shall I run and fetch - ? ' ' No , Harry can do it . ' Harry raised his wand at once . ' Accio Rosmerta 's brooms . ' A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open ; two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harry 's side , where they stopped dead , quivering slightly , at waist height . ' Rosmerta , please send a message to the Ministry , ' said Dumbledore , as he mounted the broom nearest him . ' It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realised anything is wrong ... Harry , put on your Invisibility Cloak . ' Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom ; Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back towards her pub as Harry and Dumble - dore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air . As they sped towards the castle , Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore , ready to grab him should he fall , but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant : he was bent low over his broom , his eyes fixed upon the Mark , his long silver hair and beard flying behind him in the night air . And Harry , too , looked ahead at the skull , and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble , compressing his lungs , driving all other discomfort from his mind ... How long had they been away ? Had Ron , Hermione and Ginny 's luck run out by now ? Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school , or was it Neville , or Luna , or some other member of the DA ? And if it was ... he was the one who had told them to patrol the corridors , he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds ... would he be responsible , again , for the death of a friend ? As they flew over the dark , twisting lane down which they had walked earlier , Harry heard , over the whistling of the night air in his ears , Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again . He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder for a moment when they flew over the bound - ary wall into the grounds : Dumbledore was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the castle , so that they could enter at speed . The Dark Mark was glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower , the highest of the castle . Did that mean the death had occurred there ? Dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting ; Harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around . The ramparts were deserted . The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed . There was no sign of a struggle , of a fight to the death , of a body . ' What does it mean ? ' Harry asked Dumbledore , looking up at the green skull with its serpent 's tongue glinting evilly above them . ' Is it the real Mark ? Has someone definitely been - Professor ? ' In the dim green glow from the Mark Harry saw Dumble - dore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand . ' Go and wake Severus , ' said Dumbledore faintly but clearly . Tell him what has happened and bring him to me . Do noth- ing else , speak to nobody else and do not remove your Cloak . I shall wait here . ' ' But - ' ' You swore to obey me , Harry - go ! ' Harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral stair - case , but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side . He looked round at Dumbledore , who gestured to him to retreat . Harry backed away , drawing his wand as he did so . The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted : ' Expelliarmus ! ' Harry 's body became instantly rigid and immobile , and he felt himself fall back against the Tower wall , propped like an unsteady statue , unable to move or speak . He could not understand how it had happened - Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm - Then , by the light of the Mark , he saw Dumbledore 's wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and under - stood ... Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilised Harry , and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself . Standing against the ramparts , very white in the face , Dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress . He merely looked across at his disarmer and said , ' Good evening , Draco . ' Malfoy stepped forwards , glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone . His eyes fell upon the second broom . ' Who else is here ? ' ' A question 1 might ask you . Or are you acting alone ? ' Harry saw Malfoy 's pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark . ' No , ' he said . ' I 've got back - up . There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight . ' ' Well , well , ' said Dumbledore , as though Malfoy was show- ing him an ambitious homework project . ' Very good indeed . You found a way to let them in , did you ? ' ' Yeah , ' said Malfoy , who was panting . ' Right under your nose and you never realised ! ' ' Ingenious , ' said Dumbledore . ' Yet ... forgive me ... where are they now ? You seem unsupported . ' They met some of your guard . They 're having a fight down below . They wo n't be long ... I came on ahead . I - I 've got a job to do . ' ' Well , then , you must get on and do it , my dear boy , ' said Dumbledore softly . There was silence . Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible , paralysed body , staring at the two of them , his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters ' distant fight , and in front of him , Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore who , incredibly , smiled . ' Draco , Draco , you are not a killer . ' ' How do you know ? ' said Malfoy at once . He seemed to realise how childish the words had sounded ; Harry saw him flush in the Mark 's greenish light . ' You do n't know what I 'm capable of , ' said Malfoy more forcefully , ' you do n't know what I 've done ! ' ' Oh , yes , I do , ' said Dumbledore mildly . ' You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley . You have been trying , with increasing desperation , to kill me all year . Forgive me , Draco , but they have been feeble attempts ... so feeble , to be honest , that I wonder whether your heart has been really in it ... ' ' It has been in it ! ' said Malfoy vehemently . ' I 've been work- ing on it all year , and tonight - ' Somewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muffled yell . Malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder . ' Somebody is putting up a good fight , ' said Dumbledore conversationally . ' But you were saying ... yes , you have man - aged to introduce Death Eaters into my school which , I admit , I thought impossible ... how did you do it ? ' But Malfoy said nothing : he was still listening to whatever was happening below and seemed almost as paralysed as Harry was . ' Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone , ' suggested Dumbledore . ' What if your back - up has been thwarted by my guard ? As you have perhaps realised , there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight , too . And after all , you do n't really need help ... I have no wand at the moment ... I can not defend myself . ' Malfoy merely stared at him . ' I see , ' said Dumbledore kindly , when Malfoy neither moved nor spoke . ' You are afraid to act until they join you . ' ? ' I 'm not afraid ! ' snarled Malfoy , though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore . ' It 's you who should be scared ! ' ' But why ? I do n't think you will kill me , Draco . Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe ... so tell me , while we wait for your friends ... how did you smuggle them in here ? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it . ' Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout , or to vomit . He gulped and took several deep breaths , glaring at Dumbledore , his wand pointing directly at the latter 's heart . Then , as though he could not help himself , he said , ' 1 had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one 's used for years . The one Montague got lost in last year . ' ' Aaaah . ' Dumbledore 's sigh was half a groan . He closed his eyes for a moment . That was clever ... there is a pair , I take it ? ' ' The other 's in Borgin and Burkes , ' said Malfoy , ' and they make a kind of passage between them . Montague told me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one , he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school , and sometimes what was going on in the shop , as if the Cabinet was travelling between them , but he could n't make anyone hear him ... in the end he managed to Apparate out , even though he 'd never passed his test . He nearly died doing it . Everyone thought it was a really good story , but I was the only one who realised what it meant - even Borgin did n't know - 1 was the one who realised there could be a way into Hogwarts through the Cabinets if I fixed the broken one . ' ' Very good , ' murmured Dumbledore . ' So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you ... a clever plan , a very clever plan ... and , as you say , right under my nose ... ' ' Yeah , ' said Malfoy who , bizarrely , seemed to draw courage and comfort from Dumbledore 's praise . ' Yeah , it was ! ' ' But there were times , ' Dumbledore went on , ' were n't there , when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the Cabinet ? And you resorted to crude and badly judged meas - ures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands ... poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink ... ' ' Yeah , well , you still did n't realise who was behind that stuff , did you ? ' sneered Malfoy , as Dumbledore slid a little down the ramparts , the strength in his legs apparently fading , and Harry struggled fruitlessly , mutely , against the enchantment binding him . ' As a matter of fact , I did , ' said Dumbledore . ' I was sure it was you . ' ' Why did n't you stop me , then ? ' Malfoy demanded . ' I tried , Draco . Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders - ' ' He has n't been doing your orders , he promised my mother - ' ' Of course that is what he would tell you , Draco , but - ' ' He 's a double - agent , you stupid old man , he is n't working for you , you just think he is ! ' ' We must agree to differ on that , Draco . It so happens that I trust Professor Snape - ' ' Well , you 're losing your grip , then ! ' sneered Malfoy . ' He 's been offering me plenty of help - wanting all the glory for himself - wanting a bit of the action - "
199595	200034	199580	199580	you	3805	" But I have n't told him what I 've been doing in the Room of Requirement , he 's going to wake up tomorrow and it 'll all be over and he wo n't be the Dark Lord 's favourite any more , he 'll be nothing compared to me , nothing ! ' ' Very gratifying , ' said Dumbledore mildly . ' We all like * appreciation for our own hard work , of course ... but you must have had an accomplice , all the same ... someone in Hogsmeade , someone who was able to slip Katie the - the - aaaah Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded , as though he was about to fall asleep . ' ... of course ... Rosmerta . How long has she been under the Imperius Curse ? ' ' Got there at last , have you ? ' Malfoy taunted . There was another yell from below , rather louder than the last . Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again , then back at Dumbledore , who went on , ' So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied ? And the poisoned mead ... well , naturally , Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn , believing that it was to be my Christmas present ... yes , very neat ... very neat ... poor Mr Filch would not , of course , think to check a bottle of Rosmerta 's ... tell me , how have you been communicating with Rosmerta ? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored . ' ' Enchanted coins , ' said Malfoy , as though he was compelled to keep talking , though his wand hand was shaking badly . ' I had one and she had the other and 1 could send her messages - ' ' Is n't that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledore 's Army used last year ? ' asked Dumbledore . His voice was light and conversational , but Harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it . ' Yeah , I got the idea from them , ' said Malfoy , with a twisted smile . ' I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood Granger , as well , I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognising potions ... '

' A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape 's wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest . Harry 's scream of horror never left him ; silent and unmoving , he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air : for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull , and then he fell slowly backwards , like a great rag doll , over the battlements and out of sight .

205854	205859	205749	205749	Hagrid	218	" Hagrid . . . "
205860	205904	205749	205749	Hagrid	218	" But what happened , Harry ? I jus ' saw them Death Eaters run - nin down from the castle , but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin' with 'em ? Where 's he gone - was he chasin ' them ? "
205905	205910	205911	205911	Harry	136	" He . . . "

206003	206012	205939	205939	Hagrid	218	" He 's dead . Snape killed him .... "
206013	206019	206021	206021	Hagrid	218	" Don ' say that , "
206024	206044	206021	206021	Hagrid	218	" Snape kill Dumbledore - don ' be stupid , Harry . Wha 's made yeh say tha ' ? "
206045	206051	205939	205939	Hagrid	218	" I saw it happen . "

206062	206069	206072	206072	his	136	" I saw it , Hagrid . "
206111	206128	206129	206129	Hagrid	218	" What musta happened was , Dumbledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters , "
206133	206162	206129	206129	Hagrid	218	" I suppose he 's got ta keep his cover . Look , let 's get yeh back up ter the school . Come on , Harry . ... "
206384	206393	206395	206395	Hagrid	218	" What 're they all lookin ' at ? "
206417	206427	206428	206428	Hagrid	218	" Wha 's that lyin ' on the grass ? "
206449	206483	206484	206484	Hagrid	218	" See it , Harry ? Right at the foot of the tower ? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh don ' think someone got thrown - ? "
207110	207111	207108	207108	Harry	136	" "
207114	207115	207108	207108	Harry	136	" "
207130	207131	207108	207108	Harry	136	" "
207134	207166	207167	207167	Harry	136	" He did not want to leave Dumbledores side , he did not want to move anywhere . Hagrid 's hand on his shoulder was trembling . Then another voice said , "
207172	207305	207167	207167	Harry	136	" A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward . He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it . Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize , from a trace of flowery scent on the air , that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the castle . Incomprehensible voices battered him , sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night , but Harry and Ginny walked on , back up the steps into the entrance hall . Faces swam on the edges of Harry 's vision , people were peering at him , whispering , wondering , and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase . "
207314	207318	207306	207306	We	3987	" said Ginny . "
207324	207329	207306	207306	We	3987	" said Harry . ! "
207335	207339	207332	207332	McGonagalls	624	" said Ginny . "
207353	207373	207351	207351	everyone	4750	" Fear stirred in Harry 's chest again : He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind . "
207381	207382	207374	207374	Ginny	236	" "
207391	207392	207387	207389	none of us	4876	" "
207406	207407	207400	207400	he	170	" "
207422	207438	207408	207408	He	170	" There was something in her voice , however , that Harry knew boded ill . "
207443	207444	207440	207440	you	236	" "
207488	207496	207471	207472	Madam Pomfrey	320	" Ginny 's voice trembled a little . "
207523	207524	207511	207511	Greyback	283	" "
207542	207543	207544	207544	Neville	174	" "
207613	207693	207695	207695	you	136	" They had reached the hospital wing . Pushing open the doors , Harry saw Neville lying , apparently asleep , in a bed near the door . Ron , Hermione , Luna , Tonks , and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward . At the sound of the doors opening , they all looked up . Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him ; Lupin moved forward too , looking anxious . "
207701	207702	207699	207699	Harry	136	" "
207711	207773	207709	207709	Bill	241	" Nobody answered . Harry looked over Hermione 's shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bill 's pillow , so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque . Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harsh - smelling green ointment . Harry remembered how Snape had mended Malfoy 's Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand . "
207785	207791	207776	207776	you	3997	" he asked the matron . "
207799	207804	207776	207776	you	3997	" said Madam Pomfrey . "
207821	207822	207824	207824	he	241	" "
207833	207859	207824	207824	he	241	" said Ron , who was gazing down into his brother 's face as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring . "
207877	207885	207867	207867	Bill	241	" : He looked uncertainly at Lupin . "
207900	207904	207888	207888	I	0	" said Lupin , "
207944	207945	207946	207946	Dumbledore	146	" "
207956	207960	207946	207946	Dumbledore	146	" Ron said . "
207987	207988	207989	207989	Ron	217	" "
207994	207998	207991	207991	Dumbledores	426	" said Ginny . "
208001	208085	207991	207991	Dumbledores	426	" Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry , as though hoping the latter might contradict her , but when Harry did nor , Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bill 's bed , his hands over his face . Harry had never seen Lupin lose control before ; he felt as though he was intruding upon something private , indecent . He turned away and caught Ron 's eye instead , exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what Ginny had said . "
208091	208095	208088	208088	he	426	" whispered Tonks . "
208101	208102	208103	208103	Snape	221	" "
208107	208111	208103	208103	Snape	221	" said Harry . "
208192	208209	208183	208183	Malfoy	170	" Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned . Luna 's mouth trembled . "
208229	208253	208225	208227	The Avada Kedavra	614	" Harry could n't go on . Madam Pomfrey burst into tears . Nobody paid her any attention except Ginny , who whispered , "
208258	208422	208423	208423	Molly	223	" Gulping , Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth , her eyes wide . Somewhere out in the darkness , a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before : a stricken lament of terrible beauty . And Harry felt , as he had felt about phoenix song before , that the music was inside him , not without : It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows . How long they all stood there , listening , he did not know , nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning , but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward . Like all the rest , she bore marks of the recent battle : There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped . "
208431	208472	208473	208473	Harry	136	" she said , and the spell of the music was broken : Everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances , turning again to look at Bill , or else to rub their own eyest shake their heads . "
208502	208503	208504	208504	Snape	221	" "
208508	208551	208552	208552	Snape	221	" said Harry . She stared at him for a moment , then swayed alarmingly ; Madam Pomfrey , who seemed to have pulled herself together , ran forward , conjuring a chair from thin air , which she pushed under McGonagall . "
208554	208564	208552	208552	Snape	221	" repeated McGonagall faintly , falling into the chair . "
208590	208591	208592	208592	Snape	221	" "
208599	208608	208592	208592	Snape	221	" said Lupin , his voice uncharacteristically harsh . "
208614	208615	208609	208609	We	4007	" "
208625	208629	208617	208617	Dumbledore	146	" whispered Tonks . "
208645	208647	208648	208648	He	146	" . "
208661	208682	208652	208652	he	146	" muttered Professor McGonagall , now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartan - edged handkerchief . "
208720	208721	208722	208722	I	0	" "
208735	208739	208728	208728	Snape	221	" said Tonks . "
208743	208756	208757	208757	Snape	221	" said Harry , and they all turned to look at him . "
208800	208807	208785	208785	he	221	" They all stared at him . "
208813	208818	208819	208819	Dumbledore	146	" said Lupin incredulously . "
208835	208836	208828	208828	Snape	221	" "
208850	208854	208838	208838	he	221	" said Harry , "
208871	208901	208866	208866	he	221	" Nobody asked how Harry knew this . All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock , trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened . "
208908	208926	208927	208927	My	0	" said Professor McGonagall suddenly . She looked disoriented , twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands . "
208996	208997	208990	208990	he	221	" "
209006	209011	209004	209004	Minerva	627	" said Lupin firmly . "
209029	209030	209001	209001	your	4015	" "
209049	209076	209039	209039	he	221	" asked Harry , who wanted every detail of Snape 's duplicity and infamy , feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him , to swear vengeance . "
209086	209092	209077	209077	I	0	" said Professor McGonagall distractedly . "
209196	209197	209198	209198	I	0	" "
209201	209224	209198	209198	I	0	" said Harry , and he explained , briefly , about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed . "
209235	209253	209254	209254	I	0	" Almost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione , both of whom looked devastated . "
209260	209265	209258	209258	Harry	136	" said Ron bleakly . "
209320	209321	209322	209322	He	170	" "
209337	209341	209342	209342	He	170	" said Ginny . "
209354	209355	209356	209356	His	170	" "
209361	209365	209356	209356	His	170	" said Ron . "
209375	209376	209385	209385	he	170	" "
209379	209384	209385	209385	he	170	" Ginny went on , "
209422	209423	209408	209408	he	170	" "
209430	209435	209436	209436	Fred	232	" said Ron bitterly . "
209459	209460	209461	209461	We	4013	" "
209469	209473	209461	209461	We	4013	" said Ginny . "
209552	209553	209548	209548	they	681	" "
209556	209561	209562	209562	Ron	217	" said Lupin hoarsely , "
209652	209653	209637	209639	One of them	6449	" "
209660	209664	209665	209665	He	628	" asked Harry . "
209685	209689	209672	209672	they	681	" said Lupin . "
209729	209730	209708	209708	he	628	" "
209745	209753	209755	209755	you	4042	" said Harry , turning to Hermione , "
209758	209759	209755	209755	you	4042	" "
209767	209777	209755	209755	you	4042	" whispered Hermione , her eyes sparkling with tears , "
209896	209897	209889	209889	he	221	" "
209900	209905	209889	209889	he	221	" Harry urged her . "
209913	209923	209924	209924	He	221	" said Hermione in a high - pitched whisper . "
209953	209975	209976	209976	We	4044	" She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers , so that her voice was muffled . "
210033	210034	210027	210027	we	4044	" "
210041	210046	210047	210047	Hermione	358	" said Lupin firmly . "
210070	210071	210061	210061	he	221	" "
210078	210117	210119	210119	he	221	" said Harry , who was watching Snape running up the marble staircase in his mind 's eye , his black robes billowing behind him as ever , pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended , "
210130	210131	210132	210132	We	4052	" "
210141	210149	210150	210150	Gibbon	628	" said Tonks in a low voice . "
210250	210251	210238	210238	Neville	174	" "
210259	210263	210238	210238	Neville	174	" said Ron , "
210293	210294	210265	210268	that massive Death Eater	4058	" "
210301	210305	210308	210308	he	221	" said Tonks , "
210312	210313	210308	210308	he	221	" "
210341	210345	210348	210348	him	221	" said Ginny . "
210362	210366	210348	210348	him	221	" said Lupin . "
210384	210385	210386	210386	He	221	" "
210396	210400	210386	210386	He	221	" whispered McGonagall . "
210439	210440	210441	210441	He	221	" "
210444	210449	210441	210441	He	221	" said Harry savagely , "
210488	210489	210483	210483	he	221	" "
210520	210524	210525	210525	We	4052	" said Lupin . "
210559	210560	210561	210561	We	4052	" "
210567	210575	210576	210576	We	4052	" said Tonks in a hollow voice . "
210620	210621	210622	210622	He	221	" "
210631	210635	210636	210636	He	221	" said Harry . "
210646	210773	210636	210636	He	221	" They all fell silent . Fawkes 's lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside . As the music reverberated upon the air , unbidden , unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harry 's mind . . . . Had they taken Dumbledore 's body from the foot of the tower yet ? What would happen to it next ? Where would it rest ? He clenched his fists tighdy in his pockets . He could feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand . The doors of the hospital wing burst open , making them all jump : Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up the ward , Fleur just behind them , her beautiful face terrified . "
210778	210791	210774	210776	Molly - Arthur	223	" said Professor McGonagall , jumping up and hurrying to greet them . "
210797	210798	210799	210799	Bill	241	" "
210801	210820	210799	210799	Bill	241	" whispered Mrs. Weasley , darting past Professor McGonagall as she caught sight of Bill 's mangled face . "
210825	210863	210823	210823	Bill	241	" Lupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer to the bed . Mrs. Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead . "
210870	210878	210864	210864	You	0	" Mr. Weasley asked Professor McGonagall distractedly . "
210897	210898	210895	210895	Bill	241	" "
210905	210915	210899	210899	We	4069	" said Professor McGonagall , looking helplessly at Lupin . "
210925	210929	210923	210923	Arthur	223	" .said Lupin . "
210959	210979	210942	210942	We	4069	" Mrs. Weasley took the nasty - smelling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and began dabbing at Bill 's wounds . "
210983	210988	210989	210989	Minerva	627	" said Mr. Weasley . "
211002	211042	211043	211043	Dumbledore	146	" As Professor McGonagall nodded , Harry felt Ginny move beside him and looked at her . Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur , who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face . "
211046	211075	211043	211043	Dumbledore	146	" whispered Mr. Weasley , but Mrs. Weasley had eyes only for her eldest son ; she began to sob , tears falling onto Bill 's mutilated face . "
211129	211130	211134	211134	you	4071	" "
211139	211146	211134	211134	you	4071	" said Fleur suddenly and loudly . "
211161	211174	211149	211149	you	4071	" Mrs. Weasley raised her tear - stained face , looking startled . "
211178	211179	211149	211149	you	4071	" "
211191	211195	211149	211149	you	4071	" demanded Fleur . "
211210	211211	211197	211197	theenk	4071	" "
211220	211221	211218	211218	I	0	" "
211227	211248	211224	211224	e	4072	" said Fleur , drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair . "
211262	211263	211224	211224	e	4072	" "
211272	211277	211224	211224	e	4072	" said Mrs. Weasley , "
211289	211290	211287	211287	he	241	" "
211307	211315	211304	211304	you	4071	" said Fleur , her nostrils flaring . "
211355	211416	211350	211350	I	0	" she added fiercely , pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her . Mrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up Bill 's wounds with a most curious expression upon her face . Nobody said anything ; Harry did not dare move . Like everybody else , he was waiting for the explosion . "
211423	211432	211421	211421	Muriel	436	" said Mrs. Weasley after a long pause , "
211477	211478	211458	211458	She	436	" "
211482	211487	211458	211458	She	436	" said Fleur stiffly . "
211496	211550	211551	211551	You	4076	" And then , Harry did not quite see how it happened , both , women were crying and hugging each other . Completely bewildered , wondering whether the world had gone mad , he turned around : Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks . "
211554	211566	211551	211551	You	4076	" said a strained voice . Tonks was glaring at Lupin . "
211586	211591	211593	211593	Lupin	227	" It 's different , "
211604	211618	211593	211593	Lupin	227	" Bill will not be a full werewolf . The cases are completely - "
211619	211632	211634	211634	Tonks	226	" But I do n't care either , I do n't care ! "
211647	211659	211634	211634	Tonks	226	" I 've told you a million times . . . . "
211719	211729	211731	211731	Lupin	227	" And I 've told you a million times , "
211744	211764	211731	211731	Lupin	227	" that I am too old for you , too poor . . . too dangerous . . . . "
211765	211782	211784	211785	Mrs. Weasley	218	" I 've said all along you 're taking a ridiculous line on this , Remus , "
211798	211805	211807	211807	Lupin	227	" I am not being ridiculous , "
211810	211818	211807	211807	Lupin	227	" Tonks deserves somebody young and whole . "
211819	211825	211827	211828	Mr. Weasley	220	" But she wants you , "
211835	211852	211853	211853	He	220	" And after all , Remus , young and whole men do not necessarily remain so . "
211864	211875	211877	211877	Lupin	227	" This is ... not the moment to discuss it , "
211889	211895	211884	211884	he	227	" Dumbledore is dead . ... "
211896	211917	211919	211920	Professor McGonagall	251	" Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world , "
211968	211981	211982	211982	he	220	" I 've . . . I 've done it , Professor , "
211985	212031	211982	211982	he	220	" M - moved him . Professor Sprout 's got the kids back in bed . Professor Flitwick 's lyin down , but he says he 'll be all righ ' in a jiffy , an ' Professor Slughorn says the Ministry 's bin informed . "
212032	212038	212040	212041	Professor McGonagall	251	" Thank you , Hagrid , "
212059	212106	212040	212041	Professor McGonagall	251	" I shall have to see the Ministry when they get here . Hagrid , please tell the Heads of Houses - Slughorn can represent Slytherin - that I want to see them in my office forthwith . I would like you to join us too . "
212127	212151	212121	212121	she	218	" Before I meet them I would like a quick word with you , Harry . If you 'll come with me . ... "
212157	212163	212152	212152	Harry	136	" See you in a bit "
212452	212455	212456	212456	she	251	" Harry , "
212459	212480	212456	212456	she	251	" I would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school . "
212481	212491	212493	212493	Harry	136	" I ca n't tell you that , Professor , "
212538	212546	212548	212549	Professor McGonagall	251	" Harry , it might be important , "
212551	212555	212557	212557	Harry	136	" It is , "
212559	212572	212557	212557	Harry	136	" very , but he did n't want me to tell anyone . "
212579	212581	212573	212574	Professor McGonagall	251	" Potter "
212592	212614	212583	212583	Harry	136	" in the light of Professor Dumbledore 's death , I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat - "
212615	212622	212624	212624	Harry	136	" I do n't think so , "
212628	212643	212624	212624	Harry	136	" Professor Dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died . "
212646	212689	212583	212583	Harry	136	" There 's one thing you should know before the Ministry gets here , though . Madam Rosmerta 's under the Imperius Curse , she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters , that 's how the necklace and the poisoned mead - "
212690	212693	212695	212696	Professor McGonagall	251	" Rosmerta ? "
212745	212748	212750	212750	Slughorn	216	" Snape ! "
212762	212775	212750	212750	Slughorn	216	" Snape ! I taught him ! I thought I knew him ! "
212815	212834	212796	212805	A sallow - faced wizard with a short black fringe	4101	" Minerva , the Minister will be here within seconds , he has just Disapparated from the Ministry . "
212835	212841	212847	212847	she	251	" Thank you , Everard , "
212854	212869	212870	212870	she	251	" I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here , "
212874	212915	212870	212870	she	251	" Personally , I am not convinced that the school should reopen next year . The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts 's history . It is horrible . "
212916	212930	212932	212933	Professor Sprout	344	" I am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open , "
212935	212958	212932	212933	Professor Sprout	344	" I feel that if a single pupil wants to come , then the school ought to remain open for that pupil . "
212959	212970	212972	212972	Slughorn	216	" But will we have a single pupil after this ? "
212984	213047	212972	212972	Slughorn	216	" Parents will want to keep their children at home and I ca n't say I blame them . Personally , I do n't think we 're in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else , but you ca n't expect mothers to think like that . They 'll want to keep their families together , it 's only natural . "
213048	213052	213054	213055	Professor McGonagall	251	" I agree , "
213057	213128	213054	213055	Professor McGonagall	251	" And in any case , it is not true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close . When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school - and I must say that Professor Dumbledore 's murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherin 's monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle . . . . "
213129	213136	213141	213141	his	383	" We must consult the governors , "
213166	213182	213141	213141	his	383	" We must follow the established procedures . A decision should not be made hastily . "
213183	213192	213194	213195	Professor McGonagall	251	" Hagrid , you have n't said anything , "
213197	213209	213194	213195	Professor McGonagall	251	" What are your views , ought Hogwarts to remain open ? "
213235	213256	213210	213210	Hagrid	218	" I dunno , Professor . . . that 's fer the Heads of House an the headmistress ter decide ... "
213257	213265	213267	213268	Professor McGonagall	251	" Professor Dumbledore always valued your views , "
213271	213276	213267	213268	Professor McGonagall	251	" and so do I. "
213277	213284	213286	213286	Hagrid	218	" Well , I 'm stayin , "
213307	213352	213353	213353	He	4104	" It 's me home , it 's bin me home since I was thirteen . An ' if there 's kids who wan ' me ter teach 'em , I 'll do it . But ... I dunno ... Hogwarts without Dumbledore .. . "
213368	213372	213374	213375	Professor McGonagall	251	" Very well , "
213396	213422	213390	213391	the Minister	971	" then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors , who will make the final decision . "
213458	213459	213445	213445	We	4109	" "
213466	213474	213462	213462	Dumbledore	146	" said Harry , speaking at last . "
213479	213495	213496	213496	I	0	" said Professor McGonagall , losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook . "
213516	213517	213498	213498	I	0	" "
213529	213534	213498	213498	I	0	" said Harry fiercely . "
213542	213547	213548	213552	No other headmaster or headmistress	4111	" said Professor McGonagall . "
213557	213558	213548	213552	No other headmaster or headmistress	4111	" "
213571	213575	213548	213552	No other headmaster or headmistress	4111	" growled Hagrid . "
213585	213590	213579	213579	Dumbledore	146	" said Professor Flitwick . "
213593	213598	213579	213579	Dumbledore	146	" said Professor Sprout . "
213604	213608	213609	213609	you	4116	" said Harry , "
213628	213646	213622	213622	They	1583	" The last word caught in his throat , but Professor Sprout completed the sentence for him . "
213651	213652	213579	213579	Dumbledore	146	" "
213656	213661	213579	213579	Dumbledore	146	" squeaked Professor Flitwick . "
213683	213684	213579	213579	Dumbledore	146	" "
213687	213693	213694	213694	I	0	" barked Professor Sprout . ] "
213700	213719	213720	213720	He	4122	" said Slughorn in a rather agitated voice , while Hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent . "
213724	213736	213737	213738	The Minister	971	" said Professor McGonagall suddenly , gazing down into the grounds . "
213757	213758	213749	213749	he	4122	" "
213765	213789	213763	213763	Professor	4626	" said Harry at once . He had no desire at all to see , or be interrogated by , Rufus Scrimgeour tonight . "
213793	213798	213763	213763	Professor	4626	" said Professor McGonagall . "
213802	213889	213763	213763	Professor	4626	" She strode toward the door and held it open for him . He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor ; he - had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower , but it did not matter ; there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass , not even Filch , Mrs. Norris , or Peeves . He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffindor common room . "
213894	213904	213763	213763	Professor	4626	" whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her . "
213914	213915	213910	213910	Dumbledore	146	" "
213918	214062	213910	213910	Dumbledore	146	" said Harry . She let out a wail and , without waiting for the password , swung forward to admit him . As Harry had suspected it would be , the common room was jam - packed . The room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole . He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby : This meant that the dormitory must be empty , or nearly so . Without speaking to anybody , without making eye contact at all , Harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys ' dormitories . As he had hoped , Ron was waiting for him , still fully dressed , sitting on his bed . Harry sat down on his own four - poster and for a moment , they simply stared at each other . "
214071	214075	214078	214078	they	4126	" said Harry . "
214081	214090	214078	214078	they	4126	" said Ron . There was a pause . "
214093	214113	214115	214115	you	4128	" said Ron in a very low voice , as though he thought the furniture might be listening in . "
214129	214161	214162	214162	You	4128	" Harry shook his head . All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now ; had it really happened , and only hours ago ? "
214168	214175	214162	214162	You	4128	" said Ron , looking crestfallen . "
214181	214182	214162	214162	You	4128	" "
214185	214189	214162	214162	You	4128	" said Harry . "
214203	214204	214190	214190	Someone	5066	" "
214209	214268	214190	214190	Someone	5066	" Wordlessly , Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket , opened it , and passed it to Ron . The full story could wait . ... It did not matter tonight . . . nothing mattered except the end , the end of their pointless adventure , the end of Dumbledore 's life . . . . "
214271	214275	214190	214190	Someone	5066	" whispered Ron , "
214281	214282	214190	214190	Someone	5066	" "
214285	214381	214190	214190	Someone	5066	" said Harry , lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards . He felt no curiosity at all about R.A.B. : He doubted that he would ever feel curious again . As he lay there , he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent . Fawkes had stopped singing . And he knew , without knowing how he knew it , that ilie phoenix had gone , had left Hogwarts for good , just as Dumbledore had left the school , had left the world . . . had left Harry .
